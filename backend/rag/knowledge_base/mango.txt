General Information
It is known as king of fruits and cultivated in India from old time. Mango is rich source of Vitamin A and C; its leaves are used as fodder in case of shortage of fodder while wood is used for furniture making. Unriped fruits are used for chutney, pickles and ripe fruits are used for eating purpose as well as for syrups, jam and jelly. It is commercially cultivated in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, West Bengal, Kerala, Bihar, UP, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra, Gujarat.

Land Preparation
Do ploughing, cross ploughing of land and then levelled the land.  Prepare land in such way that water stagnation should not occurred in  field. After levelling take one deeper ploughing and then divide  lands in blocks. Spacing is varied from place to place.
Sowing
Time of sowing
Planting is done in month of August-September also in February - March. Do planting in cool hours of evening. Protect crop from high wind.
Spacing
For grafted varieties use distance of 9m x 9m and plant them in square system.
Sowing Depth
Dug pits of 1x1x1m size at distance of 9x9m one month earlier before planting. Expose them to sun. Fill with mixture of soil, 30 to 40 kg of FYM or Compost and 1 kg single super phosphate.
Method of sowing
Square and hexagonal planting can be adopted. Hexagonal planting accommodates 15% more plants.
Seed
Seed Treatment
Before planting, dip stones in solution of Dimethoate for few minutes. It will protect crop from mango weevils. Seed treatment with Captan fungicide protects seeds from fungal infections.
Intercrops
After planting remove inflorescence for better vegetative  growth upto four years and at age of five, keep inflorescence for fruit  formation. During this period, intercrop can be taken as it help to  give additional income also it help to reduce weed growth. Onion,  tomato, Radish, Beans, Cabbage, Cauliflower, Moong, gram, Lentil,  Peach, Plum and Papaya etc. crops can be taken as intercrop.

For 4-6 year old crop apply increased cow dung dose by 25 kg, give Urea@200-400 gm, SSP@500-700 gm and MOP@350-700 gm per Tree.
For 7-9 year old crop, apply 60-90 kg of well decomposed cow dung, Urea@400-500 gm, SSP@750-1000 gm, MOP@700-1000 gm per tree. For 10 year or above 10 year crop, apply 100 kg of well decomposed cow dung, Urea@400-500 gm, SSP@1000 gm and MOP@1000 gm per Tree.
Give N and K dose of fertilizer in February month whereas apply whole amount of cow dung and SSP in December month.
Sometime changing weather causes fruit and inflorescences drop. If fruit drop is observed to minimize it spray 13:00:45@10gm/Ltr of water.Use mulching to minimize temperature effect. For good flowering and yield, spray 00:52:34 @150 gm/15 Ltr of water twice at 8 days interval when flowering starts. It will prevent flower drop also.
Weed Control
Weeding and earthing up should be done around newly planted crop. Intercrop can be taken till plant gets well acquainted to surrounding atmosphere upto plant start bearing. Depending upon variety it will take 5-6years. Intercropping helps to minimize weed control. Leguminous crop like moong, mash, gram and Lentil can be taken as intercrop. Also crop like onion, tomato, Radish, beans, cauliflower, cabbage are useful for intercropping. Avoid Bajra, maize and sugarcane as intercropped.
Irrigation
Amount and interval of irrigation depend upon, type of soil, climate and  source of irrigation. To young plant apply light and frequent  irrigation. Light irrigation always give best results as compared to  flood irrigation. In summer apply irrigation at interval of 5-7days  where as in winter slowly increased irrigation interval to 25-30days. In  rainy season, apply irrigation depending upon rainfall intensity.  Bearing trees required irrigation during fruit development period at  interval of 10-12days. After fertilizer application in February month  give light irrigation.
Plant protection
Pest and their control:
Mealy Bug:
It causes damage to crop by sucking sap  from inflorescences, stem, leaves and shoot. Infestation observed mostly in  January to April. Mealy bug affected part dried and sooty mould is seen  on infected parts.
To prevent tree from mealy bug infestation, 25cm width Polythene(400gauge) strip fastened around tree trunk to stop ascent of nymphs before hatching of eggs in month of Nov and Dec. If infestation is observed, spray Acephate@2gm/Ltr or Spirotetramat@3ml/Ltr of water to control mealy bug.
Mango Hopper:
Infestation is observed mostly in  February-March Month when crop is in  flowering stage. They suck sap  from inflorescences, leaves. On infection  flower get sticky and sooty  mould a black color fungus is developed on  affected parts.
If infestation is observed take Spray  Cypermethrin 25EC @3ml or  Deltamethrin 28EC@9ml or Fenvelarate20EC@5ml  or Neembicidine  1000ppm@20ml in 10Ltr water on whole tree.
Mango Fruit Fly:
It is serious pest of mango.  Females lay eggs below epidermis of young  fruits. Later on maggots feed  on pulp afterward fruits starts rotting  and get drop.
Destroy infected fruits away from field.  During fruit developed  stage, hang traps of 100ml emulsion of methyl  Engenol 0.1%. In May  month start spraying of Chlorpyrifos 20EC@2ml/Ltr  of water for three  times with interval of 20days.
Disease and their control:
Powdery Mildew:
Whitish powdery growth observed on inflorescence and the floral parts. In severe condition, they get drop. Also fruits, branches and floral part show dieback symptoms.
Before flowering, during flowering and after fruit set, take spray of 1.25kg wet able sulphur in 200litre of water. If needed, take second spray with interval of 10-15days. If infestation is observed in field, take spray of 178% Imidacloprid@3ml along with Hexaconzole@5ml/10Ltr water or Tridemorph@5ml or Carbendazim @10gm/10Ltr of water.
Stem Borer:
Serious pest of mango crop. It create  tunnel under bark and destroyed  tree by feeding on internal tissue.  Larva of stem borer excreta is  observed outside of tunnel.
If infestation is observed, clean  tunnel with hard wire and insert  cotton swab dip in mixture of Kerosene  and Chlorpyriphos in ratio of  50:50 and then closed it with mud.
Anthracnose or Dieback:
Dark brown or black spots are observed on shoots. On fruits also small, raise, dark spots are observed.
To control dieback and other diseases, cut infested, dead portion and  apply Bordo Paste on it. Spray Bordeaux mixture@10gm/Ltr of water. If  infestation observed in field take spray of Copper  oxychloride@30gm/10Ltr on infected trees. If Anthracnose observed on new  flush. Spray with Thiophanate methyl@10gm or Carbendazim@10gm/10Ltr of  water.
Black Tip:
Fruits get abnormally elongated at tips along with pre-mature ripening of fruits.
During flowering take spray of Borax@6gm/ltr of water +  Copper Oxychloride@3gm/Ltr of water for three times with 10-15days  interval.
Harvesting
Changing of fruit color is sign of fruit maturity. It usually required  15-16week after fruits set to get mature. Pick individual fruits with  help of ladder or bamboo having sharp knife and having net to collect  harvested fruits. Avoid falling of fruits on ground as it will damage  fruits during storage. After harvesting, do sorting and grading of fruits  according to size, color and then packed in boxes. Place harvested  fruits on polynet upside down.
Post-Harvest
After harvesting dip fruits in water. Reject immature fruits which  float on water. After that place fruits in 25gm/Ltr salt water. Fruits  which float in salt water are mainly used for export. According to prevention of  Food adulteration act (1954) ripening of any food by using Carbide gas  is a crime. For uniform ripening of fruits , dip 100kg fruits in 100Ltr  of water containing (62.5ml-187.5ml) Ethrel at 52±2°C for 5min within  4-8 days after harvesting. For fruit fly detection in export quality  fruits VHT (vapor heat treatment) is compulsory. For this process  use  3days prior harvested fruits.
