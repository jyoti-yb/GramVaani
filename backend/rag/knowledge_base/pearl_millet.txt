Along with human consumption, it is used for fodder purpose, its stalk are used to feed animals. Major Pearl millet growing areas in India are Punjab, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Gujarat, UP, Haryana, MP, Karnataka, AP and Tamil Nadu.
In 2002-03 in Punjab approximately 0.8 thousand hectare land is used for Bajra cultivation and gave an average yield of 3.9qtl/acre. The total yield of bajra is 0.8 thousand ton. In Punjab the major bajra producing areas are Bathinda, Faridkot, Firozpur, Mansa, Moga and Sangrur.

Land Preparation
Sowing should be done in well prepared land to get good yield. To bring the soil to fine tilth, 2-3 harrowing should be done followed by ploughing.
Sowing
Time of sowing
In less rainfall areas, sowing should be done in start July and in more rainfall areas, sowing should be done in end week of July.
Spacing
Use row to row spacing of 50cm and plant to plant spacing of 15cm.
Sowing Depth
Sow seeds at depth of 2.5cm.
Method of sowing
For sowing, use dibbling or drilling method.
Seed
Seed rate:
For improved varieties, use 1.5kg/acre for sowing. Sowing amount can be decreased upto 1kg if sowing is done in well prepared land and uniformly.
Seed Treatment:
To protect from ergot disease, dip the seeds in 20% salt solution for five minutes. Remove and destroy the seeds which are floating on water and wash remaining seeds with clean water.
Then treat seeds with Thiram@3gm/kg of seeds or with Chlorpyriphos 20EC@4ml/kg of seeds.

For loamy soil, use nitrogen@40kg/acre (urea@90kg/acre) and phosphorus@24kg/acre (DAP@55kg/acre or SSP@150kg/acre). For sandy soil, use nitrogen@25kg/acre (urea@55kg/acre) and phosphorus@12kg/acre (DAP@27kg/acre or SSP@75kg/acre).
Note:
In zinc deficiency land, add zinc heptahybrid 21% @10kg/acre or zinc sulphate monohybrid @6.5kg/acre.
Use potash element (MOP) when deficiency is detected on soil testing.
When DAP@27kg/acre and 55kg/acre is added then lowers the amount of Urea upto 10-20kg/acre.
Plant protection
Pests and their control:
Root bug:
If infestation is observed, to control do dusting of Methyl Parathion 2%@10kg/acre.
Blue beetles:
To control blue beetles do spray of 1.5% Quinalphos@250ml per acre.
Diseases and their control:
Downy Mildew:
In severe infestation, white growth appears on both upper and lower side of leaves. Earhead is transformed into leafy structure. It is spread rapidly in Cloudy weather.
If infestation is observed, to control take spray of Metalaxyl MZ@30gm/15Ltr of water. If necessary repeat spray with interval of 15 days.
Ergot:
Honeydew like substance is secretes on earheads. After 10-15days these droplet dry and turn into dark brown to black color. Seeds are replaced with black color fungus i.e sclerotia.
To protect from ergot disease, dip the seeds in 20% salt solution for five minutes. Remove and destroyed seeds which are floating on water and wash remaining seeds with clean water. As a preventive measure, at time of earhead formation, take spray of Zineb or Mancozeb@2gm/Ltr of water. Take two-three spray with interval of 3 days.
Smut:
As a preventive measure grow smut resistant varieties. If infestation is observed, remove infected plants and destroyed them away from field. Take spray of Mancozeb@2gm/Ltr of water.
Rust:
Reddish brown to reddish orange spots are developed on foliage.
If infestation is observed, to control take spray of Mancozeb 75WP@2gm/Ltr water.  If necessary repeat sprays with interval of 8 days.
Harvesting
When grains become hard containing sufficient moisture, crop is ready for harvesting. Remove earheads from standing crop with help of sickle. Some farmer cut entire plant with sickle. After harvesting collect and stalk crop in open space and dry them for four-five days.
Post-Harvest
After proper drying, do threshing operation and separate grains from earheads. Then carry out cleaning operation. Sun Dry clean seeds and bring moisture level to 12-14%. Fill grains in gunny bags and stored them in dry place.
