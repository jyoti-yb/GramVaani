Soil
Because of its hardy nature it is grown in variety of soil. The soil must contain good moisture content. It gives best result when grown under moist, deep, sandy loam soil with well drainage system. It can tolerate even shade in early seedling stage.
Land Preparation
For Bahera plantation, it requires well prepared land. To bring soil to fine tilth, plough the land. After ploughing, digging of pit is done before the onset of monsoon. In degraded areas pits are dug of larger size for good growth and development of plant.
Sowing
Time of sowing
The nursery beds are prepared in the month of June-July. Sowing is done in the month of July when there is onset of monsoon.
Spacing
For good growth use seedling spacing of 3m x 3m.
Method of sowing
Transplanting method is used of seedlings in main field.
Seed
Seed treatment
Soak the seeds in water for 24 hours to increase germination percentage.
Nursery Management And Transplanting
Sow Bahera seeds on digging pits 45cm x 45cm x 45cm. After sowing light irrigation is done to moist the soil. Sowing is done in the month of July when there is onset of monsoon.
Direct sowing can also be done but in the month of June-July when there is start of monsoon. Seeds are sown 2 inches deep and followed by line method.
Seedlings are ready for transplantation within 10-40days. The seedlings are mainly planted at the spacing of 3m x 3m. Water seedling beds 24hours before transplanting so that seedlings can be easily uprooted and be turgid at transplanting time.

At the time of land preparation, apply FYM (Farm Yard Manure)@10kg/hole. Apply fertilizer dose in the form of Urea @100g/hole, Super Phosphate @250g/hole and Muriate of Potash@100g/hole. Fertilizer dose is increases if required in future.
Weed Control
Regular weeding should be done to keep the field weed free. If weed left uncontrolled then it will reduce the crop yield. Regular weeding is done for two years. After one month of planting, weeding should be done at the interval of one month. Mulching is also an effective way to reduce soil temperature along with weed control.
Irrigation
In summer i.e. in the month of March, April and May apply irrigation 3 times in one week.
Plant protection
Pest and their control:
Semi-looper caterpillar:
They feed themselves on green and fresh leaves.
Harvesting
Harvesting is done when fruits are start turning greenish-gray in color. Harvesting is mainly done in the month of November-February. After ripening the fruits are immediately harvested.
Post-Harvest
After harvesting, drying of seeds is done. The seeds are sun dried and packed in air tight bags for transportation and to increase its self-life. From dried seeds several products like Triphala curna, Bibhitaki sura, Bhibhitaka ghrta and Triphala ghrta are made after processing.
