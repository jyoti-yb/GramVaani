General Information
Soybean called as golden beans is belongs to legume family. It is native of East Asia. It is a rich source of Protein also excellent source of fibre. Oil extracted from soybean contain small amount of saturated fat. In Punjab, it plays an important role in crop diversification.

Soil
It gives good result, when grown on well drained, fertile loamy soils. pH of 6 to 7.5 is favourable for optimum yield of soybean. Water logged, saline/alkaline soils are not suitable for its cultivation. Low temperature affect crop severely.
Popular Varieties With Their Yield
SL 525 (2003):
It has bright, brilliant, cream-colored grains with a light black (grey) hilum that are all the same size. 37.2 percent of the protein and 21.9 percent of the oil in its grains. In addition to tolerating stem blight and root-knot nematode, it is resistant to the yellow mosaic virus. It needs 144 days to reach maturity. Its’ average seed yield is about 6.1 quintals per acre.
SL 744 (2010):
Its grains are bright and light yellow in colour, and its hilum is grey. Its grains are made up of 21.0 percent oil and 42.3 percent protein. It is resistant to soybean mosaic and the yellow mosaic virus. It matures in about 139 days. It produces about 7.3 quintals of seeds per acre on average.
SL 958 (2014):
Its grains are shiny and light yellow in colour, and its hilum is black. Protein makes up 41.7 percent of its grains, and oil makes up 20.2 percent. It has a high level of immunity to soybean mosaic virus and yellow mosaic virus. The maturation period is roughly 142 days. Its average seed output per acre is around 7.3 quintals.

Land Preparation
Prepared field by giving two to three ploughings followed by planking.
Sowing
Time of sowing
First fortnight of June is best time for sowing Soybean.
Spacing
While sowing use row to row spacing of 45 cm and plant to plant spacing of 4-7 cm.
Sowing Depth
Sow seeds at depth of 2.5-5 cm.
Method of sowing
Sow seeds with help of seed drill.
Seed
Seed Rate
Use seed rate of 25-30 kg for sowing in one acre land.
Seed Treatment
To protect seeds from soil borne diseases, treat seeds with Thiram or Captan@3 gm per kg of seeds.

Apply if deficiency observed
Apply FYM or well decomposed cowdung@4 ton/acre. Also apply Nitrogen@12.5 kg and Phosphorus@32 kg in form of Urea@28kg and SSP@200 kg per acre at time of sowing.
To obtain good growth and optimum yield, take spray of Urea@3 kg/150 ltr of water on 60th and 75th day after sowing.
Weed Control
To keep field weed free, two hoeing are required, give first hoeing 20 days after sowing and second hoeing 40 days after sowing.
To control weed chemically, after sowing, within two days, take spray of Pendimethalin@800 ml/acre in 100-200 ltrs of water.
Irrigation
Overall crop required three to four irrigation. Irrigation at time of pod filling stage is necessary. Water stress at this period will affect yield drastically. Apply irrigation depending upon rainfall conditions. No irrigation required in good rainfall conditions.
Plant protection
Pest and their control:
White Fly:
For white fly control, take spray of Thiamethoxam@40 gm or Triazophos@300 ml/acre. If necessary take second spray 10 days after first spray.
Tobacco caterpillar:
If infestation is observed, take spray of Acephate 57SP@800 gm/acre or Chlorpyriphos 20EC@ 1.5 ltr/acre. If necessary take second spray 10 days after first spray.
Hairy Caterpillar:
To control hairy caterpillar pick caterpillar manually and destroyed by crushing or putting in kerosene water when infestation is low. In case of high infestation, take spray of Quinalphos@300 ml or Dichlorvos@200 ml/acre.
Blister beetle:
They cause damage at flowering stage. They feed on flowers, buds thus prevent grain formation.
If infestation is observed, take spray of Indoxacarb 14.5SC@200 ml or Acephate 75SC@800 gm/acre. Carry out spraying in evening hours and if necessary take second spray 10 days after first spray.
Disease and their control:
Yellow mosaic virus:
It is spread due to white fly. Irregular yellow, green patches are observed on leaves. Pods not developed on infected plants.
Grow yellow mosaic virus resistant varieties. For white fly control, take spray of Thiamethoxam@40 gm, Triazophos@ 400 ml/acre. If necessary take second spray 10 days after first spray.
Harvesting
Pods become dry and leaves changes their color to yellow and fall of, it is sign of crop is ready for harvesting. Harvest the crop with sickle or by hand. After harvesting, carry out threshing operation.
Post-Harvest
After drying, carry out proper cleaning of seeds. Remove small size seeds, damaged seeds and crop stalks.
