Soil
It is grown in variety of soils ranging from loam to sandy loam soil. It gives best result when grown in rich heavy soil. Avoid cultivation in light sandy soils as it affects the crop growth. For good growth it requires pH ranging from 5.8-7.0.
Popular Varieties With Their Yield
TL 1
: It is developed in 1993. The plant of this variety is maize borer resistant. Leaves remain green till maturity. Seeds have hard covering and are slaty-brown in color.
Other two varieties such as
Sirsa improved
and
Rhuri
are also developed.
Land Preparation
For Teosinte plantation, it requires well prepared land. To bring land to good level, plough land once with harrow followed by two ploughings with planking. Plantation is done on prepared beds.
Sowing
Time of sowing
Prepare nursery in the month of May-June and seeds are sown in the month of June-July. Avoid sowing in the month of august as it gives low yield.
Spacing
Depending upon plant growth habit, sow seeds at the spacing of "30 cm x 40 cm" and of convenient width.
Sowing Depth
Depth of sowing is 3-4 cm.
Method of sowing
Sowing can be done with help of Kera or Seed drill.
Seed
Seed rate
For good pollinated varieties use seed rate of 16 kg/acre.

Depending upon soil test results
At the time of land preparation, apply Farm Yard Manure @8tonnes/acre.  Apply fertilizer dose of Nitrogen or urea at the time of sowing  @20kg/acre or @44kg/acre respectively. Broadcasting of Nitrogen or urea  @20kg/acre or @44kg/acre respectively is done after 1 month of sowing.
Application of Phosphorus and potassium is done for soil test if beds are soil deficient.
Weed Control
Perform frequent weeding and hoeing for effective weed control.  If weed left uncontrolled then it will reduce the crop yield. For effective weed control spraying of Atrataf 50 WP (Atrazine) @400g/acre in 200 ltr of water is done within 2-3 days after sowing. It is effective in controlling itsit/chapati annual weeds. . Mulching is also an effective way to reduce soil temperature along with weed control.
Irrigation
Depending upon climate and soil, the irrigation is mainly done at an interval of 8-10 days.
Plant protection
Pest and their control:
Maize borer
: Mainly it attacks in the early stages of crop growth.
Treatment: Spraying of Sevin 50 WP(carbaryl) @100-150gm/acre is given to treat Maize borer.
Harvesting
Harvesting is mainly done after 80-100 days of sowing. Harvesting is done when tassel appear on the crop. The fodder remains green for longer time and is full of nutrients at this stage. Sun dried crops are harvested.
Post-Harvest
After harvesting, thrashing is done. Thrashing is mainly done by beating the crop or running the tractor over the crop. Before storing white seeds are separated. After separation the fodder is stored in gunny bags or in closed area. The seed yield of Teosinte is around 5 quintals/acre.
