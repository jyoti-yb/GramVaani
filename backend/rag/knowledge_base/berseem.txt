Weed Control
Bueen is serious weeds of Berseem crop. To control this weed before sowing, spray Fluchloralin @ 400 ml/200 Litres of water per acre on seed bed.
Irrigation
Apply first irrigation, within 3 to 5 days in light soil and 6-8 days in heavy soils. Remaining irrigation should be applied at 8-10 days interval in summer and 10-15 days during winter.
Plant protection
Pest and their control:
Grass hopper:
It damage crop by eating leaves. It occurred mostly in May-June month. If infestation is observed, spray crop with Malathion 50 EC @ 500 ml in 80-100 Ltr of water per acre. After spraying do not feed cattle for seven days.
Gram Caterpillar:
Avoid raising of crop nearby tomato,  gram, late sown wheat. If infestation is observed spray with  Chlorantraniliprole 18.5 SL @ 50 ml or Spinosad 48 SC @ 60 ml per acre  in 80-100 Ltr water with help of knapsack sprayer.
Disease and their control:
