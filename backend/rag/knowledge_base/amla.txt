Land Preparation
For Amla plantation, it required well ploughed and organic soil. To bring soil to fine tilth, plough land before planting. Organic fertilizers such as FYM are mixed with the soil. Then nursery beds are prepared 2.5cm deep and 15cm x 15cm size.
Sowing
Time of sowing
Amla cultivation is done in the month of July to September. In Udaipur cultivation is done in the month of January to February.
Spacing
Sow budded seedling at a distance of 4.5m x 4.5m in the month of May-June.
Sowing Depth
The pits of 1 metre square are dug and are left as such for 15-20 days for exposure to sun.
Method of sowing
Transplanting of budded seedlings in main field.
Seed
Seed Rate
For good growth use seed rate of 200gm/acre.
Seed treatment
To protect crop from soil borne disease and pest and for better germination, before sowing seeds are treated with Gibberellic acid @200-500ppm. After chemical treatment seeds are air-dried.
Fertilizer
Nutrient Requirement (gm/plant)
NITROGEN

At the time of land preparation, apply 10 kg FYM and mix well with soil. Apply fertilizer dose of N:P:K in the form of nitrogen @100 gm/plant, phosphorus @50 gm/plant and potassium @100 gm/plant. Fertilizer dose is given to one year old plant and increased constantly up to 10 years. Full dose of phosphorus and half dose of potassium and nitrogen are given as basal dose in the month of January-February. The remaining half dose is given in the month of august. In sodic soils, boron and zinc sulphate @100-500g is given as per tree age and vigour.
Weed Control
Do frequent weedings to make field weed free. Training and pruning is also done. Criss cross branches are cut and only 4-5 straight branches are left behind for further growth.
Mulching is also an effective way to control soil weeds. In summer, mulching is done from the base of tree up to 15-10cm of the trunk.
Irrigation
In summer, apply irrigation with interval of 15 days and in winter, give water through drips @25-30litres/day/tree in October-December month. In monsoon month, it does not require irrigation. Avoid irrigation during the flowering period.
Plant protection
Pest and their control:
Bark eating caterpillar:
They damage the stem and bark by feeding themselves.
Application of quinalphos @0.01% or fenvalerate @0.05% is given in their holes to protect from insect.
Gall caterpillar:
They bore in apical meristem and makes tunnel.
Application of Dimethoate @0.03% is given to control the pest.
Disease and their control:
Rust:
Circular red rust appear on the leaves and on fruits.
Application of Indofil M-45 @0.3% is given twice. Once is given in early September and then after 15 days to control crop from diseases.
Internal necrosis:
mainly caused due to the deficiency of boron. Tissues turn brown and then black are the symptoms of this disease.
Application of boron @0.6% is done in the month of September to October to get rid of this disease.
Fruit rot
: The symptoms of this disease are swelling and color changing of fruits.
Application of borax or NaCl @0.1%-0.5% is done to cure from this disease.
Harvesting
Plant starts yielding in about 7-8 years after planting. Harvesting is done in the month of February when fruits are green in color and have maximum ascorbic acid content. Harvesting is done by vigorous shaking of tree. When fruits get fully mature they turn into dull greenish-yellow color. For processing and seeds extraction, mature fruits are used.
Post-Harvest
After harvesting, grading is done. Then fruits are packed in bamboo baskets or crates or wooden boxes. For the less spoilage of crop perfect packing is done and quick transport is required. From amla fruits several products like amla powder, churna, chavanprash, arista and sweet preserves are made.
