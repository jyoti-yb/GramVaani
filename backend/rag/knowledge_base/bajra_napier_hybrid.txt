General Information
Bajra or pearl millets is grown for grain as well as for fodder purpose whereas Napier or elephant grass is mainly cultivated as forage crop. Napier-bajra is hybridization between bajra and elephant grass. This hybrid increases number of tillers thus yield, quality of forage also minimize risk of becoming weed in case of napier. After plantation, it give yield continuously upto 2-3 years.

Land Preparation
Plough land once by mould board lough and then do harrowing for two times to bring soil to fine tilth. After ploughing, do planking to make soil levelled. Make ridges and furrows at distance of 60 cm.
Sowing
Time of sowing
Under irrigated conditions, optimum time for planting is from last week of February to May. For rainfed areas, sowing can be done from June to August.
Spacing
For good growth and yield spacing of "90 cm x 40 cm" or "60 cm x 60 cm" is recommended
Sowing Depth
Stem cutting are sown at depth of 7-8 cm in furrow.
Seed
Seeds of napier bajra are very small so for commercial planting it is propagated vegetative with help of stem cuttings (having two- three nodes) or root slips (approximately 30cm long). For planting one acre use 11,000 slips or stem cuttings. Under irrigated conditions, optimum time for planting is from last week of February to May. For rainfed areas, sowing can be done from June to August.

At time of field preparation add well decomposed cow dung@20ton/acre.15 days after sowing, add Nitrogen@30kg/acre in form of Urea@70kg/acre. After each cutting, repeat this nitrogen dose. Apply Phosphorus@40kg/acre in form of SSP@240kg/acre in two equal splits, first dose in spring and second dose in monsoon.
Weed Control
To controlled weeds, do intercropping with suitable legumes. Intercropping enriches soils, also provide nutritional fodder to cattle’s also take care of weeds.
Irrigation
Apply irrigation during summer month or hot and dry months depending upon soil type and climate conditions.
Harvesting
Harvesting should be done after 50 days of sowing. After first cutting, when crop height becomes one meter, take second cutting. Do not allow to grow crop for more than 2 meter as it will leads in decreased in nutritional value of fodder. Such fodder is heavy for digestion.
