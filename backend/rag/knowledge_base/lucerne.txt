Land Preparation
Prepared field thoroughly and prepared levelled seed bed. Plough land once with help of disk plough and three times with cultivator. After every ploughing do planking to make seed bed levelled.
Sowing
Time of sowing
Best time for lucerne sowing in Punjab, is middle of October.
Spacing
At time of sowing keep row to row distance of 30 cm
Sowing Depth
sow seeds at depth of 2-4 cm in soil.
Method of sowing
For Sowing broadcasting method is used. Before lucerne sowing, broadcast oats@15kg/acre and mix well in soil with help of cultivator.

At time of sowing, apply Nitrogen@10kg in form of Urea@22kg, Phosphorus@32kg in form of SSP@200kg per acre.
Weed Control
To keep field weed free, carry out first hoeing one month after sowing. In rainy season weed infestation is high at that time take hoeing operation according to weed intensity.
Irrigation
Apply first irrigation, one month after sowing and depending upon soil type and climate, apply remaining irrigations at interval of 15-30 days. No irrigation is needed during rainy season.
Plant protection
Pest and their control:
Alfalfa Aphid
: Serious pest of lucerne crop. If infestation is observed, to control take spray of Malathion 50EC@350ml in 150 litre of water per acre.
Lucerne caterpillar, jassid and weevil
: If infestation is observed, take spray of Hexavin 50WP@450gm or Malathion 50EC@ 400ml in 150 Ltr of water per acre.
Disease and Their control:
Rust
: If not controlled timely can reduce yield  severely. Small brown spots are observed on leaves with black or brown  color at centre. If infestation is observed, take spray of Mancozeb  (Dithane M-45)@25gm/10 Ltr of water.
Leaf spot:
It is mostly found in north and central  India. Affected plant turn yellow and leaves gets drop off. If  infestation is observed, take spray of Mancozeb (Dithane M-45) or   Chlorothalonil@300gm/150 Ltr of water.
Harvesting
After sowing, crop is ready to harvest for cutting in 75 days. Remaining cuttings are taken at interval of 30-40 days.
Post-Harvest
When crop is raised for seed production, carry out last cutting in mid-march. When crop is at full blossom stop irrigation, it will help in good seed yield. After pods get dry, complete harvesting immediately to avoid shedding of pods. From one acre 75-100 kg of seed yield is obtained.
