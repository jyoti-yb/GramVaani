If infestation occur in standing crop, drench with Imidacloprid@4ml/10litre of water or Chlorpyriphos@5ml/10Ltr of water.\nCut worm:\nCaterpillar remain hide in soil at depth of 2-4 inch. It cut at base of plant, branches or stem. Eggs are laid down in soil. Larva is dark brown with red head.\nAdopt crop rotation. Use only well decomposed cow dung. At early stage pick caterpillar by hand and then destroyed them. Avoid plantation of Tomato. Okra near gram field. In low infestation spray Quinalphos 25EC@400 ml/200-240 litres water per acre. In case of severe infestation Spray with Profenophos 50EC@600 ml/acre in 200-240 litres of water.\nGram pod borer:\nThis is the most serious pest of chickpea and causes damage up to 75% reduction in yield. It feed on leaves causes skeletonization of leaves also feeds on flower and green pods. On pods they make circular holes and feed on grains.\nInstall Pheromone traps for Helicoverpa armigera@5/acre. In case of low infestation, handpicked grown up larvae. At early stage use HNPV or Neem extract@50 gm/litre of water. Use of chemicals are necessary after ETL level. (ETL: 2 early instar larvae/plant or 5-8 eggs/plant).\nSpray Deltamethrin 1%+Triazophos35%@25 ml/10 litre water when crop is at 50% flowering stage. Spray Emamectin Benzoate 5%G@3 gm/10 litre of water 15 days after first spray of Deltamethrin+Triazophos.\nIn case of severe infestation spray Emamectin Benzoate 5%SG@7-8 gm/15 litre or 20%WG Flubendiamide@8 gm/15 litre water.\nDisease and their control:\nBlight:\nDark brown spot with dot like bodies developed on stem, branches, leaflet and pods. In case of excessive rain whole plant get severely affected with blight.\nFor cultivation use resistant varieties. Before sowing carryout seed treatment with fungicide. On incidence of disease spray with Indofil M-45 or Captan @360 gm/100 ltr of water per acre. If necessary repeat the spray at interval of 15 days.\nGray Mold\n: Small water soaked spots are observed on leaflets. Spots on infected leaves become dark brown. In severe infestation, brown necrotic spots appear on twigs, petioles, leaves and flowers of the plant on attaining full vegetative growth. The affected stem finally breaks and the plant dies.\nBefore sowing carry out seed treatment. If infestation is observed, spray crop with Carbendazim@2 gm/ltr of water.\nRust\n: This disease is more severe in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Small, round to oval, light or dark brown pustules are formed on the under surface of the leaves. In later stage, pustules get black and affected leaves get defoliate.\nUse rust resistant varieties for cultivation. If symptoms are observed spray the crop with Mancozeb 75WP@2 gm/ltr of water. With interval of 10 days take two more sprays.\nWilt:\nThis disease causes considerable loss in yield. In can affect at the seedling stage as well as in an advanced stage of plant growth. Initially affected plant show dropping of petioles and gives dull green color. Afterwards all leaves turn yellow and become straw colored.\nGrow resistant varieties. In primary stage of wilt, to control mix 1 kg of Trichoderma in 200 kg well decomposed cow dung and keep it for 3 days, then apply it in wilt affected area. If wilt is observed in fields, spray 300 ml Propiconazol with 200 litre of water per acre."

A short pinkish caterpillar bores into the terminal shoot and eats internal tissue in initial stages, later it bores into the young fruit. The large holes can be seen on the infected fruits. The insect affected fruits become unfit for consumption.\nScout field every week after transplanting for fruit and shoot borer infestation. Remove and destroyed infected fruits. Take spray of Triazophos@20ml/10Ltr water and Neem extract@50gm/Ltr, one month after transplanting. Repeat spray with interval of 10-15 days. When crop is in flowering stage take spray of Chlorantraniliprole 18.5%SC (Coragen)@5ml+Teepol@5ml in 12 Ltr of water, twice with 20 days interval.\nIn initial stage of infestation, take spray of 5% Neem extract@50gm/Ltr. If infestation is seen in field take sprayed of 25% Cypermethrin@2.4 ml/10Ltr of water on affected crops. For high population spray Spinosad@1ml/Ltr of water. Avoid spraying of Triazophos or any other insecticide after fruit maturation and harvest.\nAphids\n: The plants are also attacked by mite, aphids  and mealy bug. They suck the sap from the leaves resulting in yellowing  and drooping of leaves.\nIf infestation of Aphid, white fly is observed in field to control take  spray of Deltamethrin + Triazophos combination@ 10ml/10Ltr of water. To  keep check on white fly spray with Acetamiprid@5gm/15Ltr of water.\nThrips:\nTo check severity of thrips, keep blue sticky traps@6-8  per acre and to reduce the incidence take spray of Verticillium  lecani@5gm/Ltr of water. If incidence of thrips is more, to control take  spray of Fipronil@2ml/Ltr of water.\nMite\n: If infestation of Mite is observed in field, to control take spray of Abamectin@1-2ml/Ltr or Fenazaquin@2ml/Ltr of water.\nLeaf eating caterpillar:\nSome time Incidence of caterpillars is seen mostly at initial stage of crop.\nTo control spray with neem based pesticides. If those are not that  effective and infestation become high then only take spray of chemicals  pesticides like Emamectin benzoate@4gm or Lambda Cyhalothrin@2ml/1Ltr of  water.\nDisease and their control\nRoot Knot Nematodes\n: It is common in brinjal crop. These are more harmful at initial stage of seedlings. They cause root galls. Due to infestation of root knot nematodes, plant get stunted, give yellow appearance and thus affect yield.\nAvoid monocropping and follow crop rotation. Incorporate Carbofuran or Phorate@5-8kg/acre in the soil.\nDamping Off:\nMoist and poorly drain soil causes damping  off disease. It is soil borne disease. Water soaking and shrivelling of  stem occurs. Seedlings killed before emergence. If it appears in nursery  the entire lot of seedling may get destroyed. It is a serious disease  of brinjal.\nBefore sowing do seed treatment with Thiram@3gm per Kg of seeds. Do soil  solarisation of nursery soil. If damping off is observed in nursery.  Drained out water and drenched soil of nursery with Copper  Oxychloride@3gm/Ltr of water.\nPhomopsis Blight and Fruit Rot:\nDark brown color spots appear on leaves. The fruit show watery lesion and becomes black in appearance.\nBefore sowing do seed treatment with Thiram@3gm per kg of seeds. Use  blight disease resistant variety for cultivation. If infestation  observed in field take spray of Zineb@2gm/Ltr of water or Mancozeb@2.5gm  per litre of water.\nLittle Leaf:\nThe affected leaves become thinner. The  petal turn green leaf like. Infected plant does not bear fruit. The  disease is transmitted by leaf hopper.\nUse disease resistant variety. In nursery use 10% Foret (20 gm, for 3 X  1 m broad bed). At time of sowing apply Phorate in between two rows of  seeds. If infection observed, at initial stage, removed disease affected  plants. Spray the crop with Dimethoate or Oxydemiton Methyl@1ml per  litre of water. Little leaf is spread mainly through Aphid infestation, to keep check on Aphid Population spray with Thiamethoxam  25%WG@5gm/15Ltr of water.\nMosaic:\nLight and green patches observed on leaves. Small bubbles or Blisters are form on leaves and leaf size remains small.\nSelect healthy and disease free seeds for cultivation. Uproot and  destroyed infected plant away from field. Recommendations given for  aphids may be adopted. (Take spray of Acephate 75SP@1gm/Ltr or Methyl  demeton 25EC@2ml/Ltr of water or Dimethoate@2ml/Ltr of water.\nWilt:\nDropping of entire leaves along with yellowing of  crops. Wilting or drying of entire plant is seen. If infected stems cut  and dipped in water, a white milky stream appears.\nFollow crop rotation. Cultivation of brinjal after french bean  helps in controlling wilt. Remove and destroyed infected plant parts  away from field.

    "content": "Disease and their control\nFusarium wilt:\nPlants become stunted, yellow,  followed by defoliation. Yellowing first occurs around leaf edges and  advances inward. Infected plants fruit earlier and produce smaller  bolls. It causes a blackening and discoloration just found in a ring  just beneath the bark. It affect at all stage of crop.\nUse resistant variety to control Fusarium wilt. Avoid continuous  planting of cotton in same field. Follow proper crop rotation. Provide  good drainage. Treat seed with Trichoderma viride formulation @ 4 gm/kg  of seed. To control prepare the solution of Thiophanate Methyl @10 gm  and Urea each of 50 gm/10 litre of water and apply near base of plants.\nAlternaria Leaf spot:\nSmall, pale to brown, round or  irregular spots of circular to semi-circular size with broad margins  appear on leaves. Affected leaves become dry and get fall off. It may  causes cankers on stem. Infection is spread to boll, then rotting of  boll occurred afterwards they get fall off. Plants stressed by drought,  nutrient deficiency and other pests are more susceptible to the disease.\nTo control this disease, spray Tebuconazole@1 ml/litre or  Trifloxystrobin+Tebuconazole@ 0.6 g/litre, on 60th, 90th and 120 days  after sowing. If infestation of disease is observed in field, spray with  Copper Oxychloride or Captan@500 gm/200 Ltr of water per acre or 12%  Carbendazim + 63% WP Mancozeb@25 gm/10 Ltr water.\nCercospora leaf spot:\nCircular red lesions on leaves which enlarge and turn white or grey in the centre; lesions often have a pattern of concentric rings and possess a red margin. Dark grey spore masses form in the centres of the lesions making them appear dark grey.\nIf infestation of disease is observed in field, spray crop with Copper Oxychloride@3 gm/litre or Mancozeb@2.5 gm/ltr, 3 to 4 times in every 15 days interval.\nAnthracnose:\nsmall, reddish or light colored  diseased spots are observed on plant leaves. Wounds are form on stem and  thus plant get weaken. It attack boll at any stage and infection spread  to lint and seed. The bolls affected by the disease have small,  water-soaked, circular, slightly depressed, reddish brown spots.\nBefore sowing, treat seeds with Captan or Carbendazim @3-4 gm/kg of  seeds. Avoid water logging in field. If infection observed, remove  affected plant and destroyed them away from field and take Spraying with  Carbendazim @1 gm/lit of water.\nRoot rot\n: Sudden and complete wilting of plants. Leaves give yellow appearance. Affected plants can be easily pulled out. Except the tap root, few secondary roots are fresh which holds the plant and other roots are decayed.\nBefore sowing apply neem cake@60 kg/acre to the soil. Treat seeds with T. viride @ 4 gm/kg of seeds to reduce root rot incidence. If infection is observed do spot drenching of Carbendazim@1 gm/lit at the base of affected plants as well as surrounding healthy plants.\n•\nPest and their protection\nAmerican Bollworm:\nEggs are laid singly on both upper and lower leaf surfaces. Newly hatched larva is yellowish white with brown black head. Later, body color changes to darker and after that changes to brownish. Due to infestation of this pest, circular holes are observed on boll. Presence of granular faecal pellets outside the bore hole. Single larva can damage 30-40 bolls. To check infestation use light traps, pheromone traps.\nAvoid continuous cropping of cotton. Avoid mono-cropping. Growing of less preferred crops like green gram, black gram, soybean, castor, sorghum etc., along with the cotton as inter-crop or border crop to reduce the pest infestation. Before sowing of cotton, remove crop residue of previous crops. Use optimum quantity of water and avoid excess use of nitrogen fertilizer. Use resistive varieties. Don’t use synthetic Pyrethroids to control American Bollworm. In case of severe infection Spray any one from Cypermethrin @ 1 ml/Ltr of water or Deltamethrin @1 ml/Ltr of water or Fenvalerate @1 ml/Ltr or Lambda cyhalothrin @1 ml/Ltr of water on affected crops, depending upon availability. For effective control of boll worms, never spray pesticides of single group more than once.\nPink boll worm:\nYoung larva is of white color and late instar is vary in color ranging from almost black, brown or green to pale or pink. To monitor adult moths activity, use pheromone trap. If infestation is observed do dusting of Carbaryl 5%D@10 kg/acre. In case of severe infestation, spray with Triazophos 40 EC@300 ml/acre.\nTobacco Caterpillar:\nIt attacks on crop in group and Scrapping the epidermal layer, leaving the skeleton of veins of leaf. During severe attack only stem and side shoots will be standing. Eggs of tobacco caterpillar are of golden brown and appears in masses. Larva is of greenish color.\nUse light trap to know intensity of pest. Set up the sex pheromone trap at 5/acre. Do manual inspection for pest. Larva are found in cluster, collect and destroyed early stage larva also grown up caterpillar. In case of high infestation spray any one of the insecticides, Chlorpyriphos 20 EC@1 Ltr/acre or Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC@50 ml/acre or Diflubenzuron 25%WP@100-150 gm/acre. Spraying of insecticides should be done either in the early morning or in the evening.\nJassids\n: Nymphs and adults of jassids suck sap from underside leaves and causing of curling. Leaves turn red or brown then dry up and shed. Apply Carbofuran 3 G@14 kg or Phorate 10 G@5 kg/acre near to root zone in moist soil. When upper canopy show yellowing and curling of leaves on 50% of plants, take spraying of insecticides. Spray Imidacloprid 17.8 SL@40-50 ml or Thiamethoxam @40 gram or Acetamiprid @75 gm/acre/200 liters of water.\nSpotted Bollworm:\nLarva is of dull green, black bristles color and having lines of black spots on body. Due to incidence of bollworm, drying and drooping of terminal shoots during pre–flowering stage is observed. It create holes on boll and then causes rotting of boll.\nIf infestation is observed, to control spray with Profenophos 50 EC@500 ml/200 Ltr of water/acre.\nMealy bugs:\nFound under surface of leaves in clusters and secrete wax like substance. Due to honey dew like secretion, sooty mould is developed and affected plant gives sick, black appearance.\nGrow Maize, bajra and jawar as barrier crops. Do not throw mealy bug infested uprooted plants in water channels or vacant spaces, instead burn them. Do not allow congress grass to grow around cotton fields, as they increase the possibility of attack by mealy bug. To control spread of mealy bugs in newer areas, avoid movement of human beings or animals from infected area to healthy crop. At initial stage, Neem seed kernel extract (NSKE 5%) 50 ml/ltr + Detergent powder@1 gm/ltr can be sprayed as spot application on infested plants. In case of severe infestation, spray Profenophos@500 ml/acre in 150 Ltr of water. Mix one teaspoon washing powder in each 15 Ltr tank Or Quinalphos25 EC@5 ml/liter of water or Chlorpyriphos20 EC @3 ml/liter of water.\nWhite fly:\nNymph are of yellow oval while adult are of yellow body covered with a white waxy bloom. They suck the sap from leaves, which lead into poor photosynthesis. It also act as a medium of transferring leaf curl virus disease. In severe infestation defoliation, shedding of boll and poor opening of boll is observed. Developed sooty mould and plant give sick, black appearance.\nAvoid continuous growing of cotton in same field. Adopting crop rotation with non-preferred hosts such as sorghum, ragi, maize etc., Avoid excess vegetative growth for that avoid excess use of nitrogen. Do timely sowing of crop. Keep field clean. Cultivation of most preferred alternate host crops like eggplant, okra, tomato, tobacco and sunflower may be avoided. Install yellow sticky traps for monitoring white fly (2 traps/acre). If infestation white flies is observed then to control, Spray Triazophos @3 ml/Ltr or Thiacloprid @4.5 gm/Ltr water or Acetamiprid@4 gm or 75 WP Acephate@800 gm/200 Ltr water or Imidachloprid@40 ml/acre dissolved in 200 litre of water or Thiamethoxam@40 gm/acre using 200 litre water.\nThrips\n: Both nymphs and adults lacerate & feed the sap from under surface of leaves. Upper side of leaf turns brown and lower side becomes silvery white.\nSeed treatment with imidacloprid 70 WS@7 ml/kg protect the crop from aphids,leaf-hoppers and thrips up to 8 weeks. Spray any one of the insecticides like Methyl demeton 25 EC@160 ml/acre, Buprofezin 25%SC@350 ml/acre, Fipronil 5% SC@200-300 ml/acre, Imidacloprid 70% WG @10-30 ml/acre, Thiamethoxam 25% WG 30 gm/acre in 200 Ltr of water per acre.\nDeficiency and their remedy\nLeaf Reddening\nInitially observed in mature leaves then spread throughout canopy. Leaf reddening can be corrected by proper fertilizer management. Take Foliar spray of MgSO\n4\n@1kg, followed by Urea@2kg/100Ltr water\nNitrogen Deficiency\nPlant growth get stunted and leaves become light green color. Lower leaves show yellowing. In severe conditions, leaves get brown and dry.\nPhosphorus Deficiency\nYounger Leaves show more dark green appearance. Older leaves become small in size and developed purple and red pigmentation.\nPotash Deficiency\nDue to potash deficiency, shading of leaves is observed also boll opening is not proper. Leaves get curled and become dry.\nZinc Deficiency\nGrowth get affected and plant become stunted. Terminal buds show drying off followed by distorted tips or young leaves."

In north India, for finger millet crop rotation with gram, mustard, tobacco, barley, linseed is commonly followed.\n2) Intercropping:\nIn Punjab, finger millet and soybeans are mixed together in 90:100 percent proportion by weight basis and sown is also practiced. Finger millet + soybean in kharif and oats in rabi is an ideal and remunerative cropping sequence for northern hilly region.\nIn rainfed crop, carry out ploughing operation in main field 2-3 times deeply to conserved moisture in soil. Before sowing secondary tillage with cultivator and multiple tooth hoe to prepare smooth seed bed is necessary. Before sowing do minor land smoothening operations, it helps in better in-situ moisture conservation. In Uttaranchal where frequent ploughing operations are difficult to carry out effective digging and turning of soil, removing perennial weeds, land smoothening, providing inward slope with a shallow drain helps in taking out excess rain water."

Maintain optimum plant population in field by doing gap filling and thinning operation in field. After 20-27 days of sowing, when plants are established in field, thinning operation means removing of excess seedling is necessary. Similarly, where ever plant population is not uniform, gap filling with 20-25 days seedlings should be used.\nSeed Treatment\nSoak seed in water (one litre water for every kg of seeds) for 6 hours. Drain the water and tightly tied the seeds in wet cloth bag for two days. After two days remove seeds from wet cloth bag, they will show some sign of germination. Dry them in shade for two days. Use such seeds for sowing purpose. Treating seeds with Azospirillum brasilense (N fixing bacterium) and Aspergillus awamori (P solubilizing fungus)@25 gm/kg seed is beneficial.

It gives higher yield compared to direct seeded crop. Transplanted crops do not lodges during heavy rains.\nTransplantation method:\nSow seeds in well prepared nursery in month of May-June. About 2 kg seeds are required to give enough seedlings to transplant 1 acre of land. For transplantation purpose use three to four weeks old seedlings. Before pulling the seedling, nursery should be irrigated. Prepare slurry with 2 packets 300 gm/acre of Azospirillum inoculant in 40 Ltr of water and dip the root portion of the seedlings in the solution for 15-30 min and transplant. Transplant two seedlings/hill at distance of 25x8 cm or 25x10 cm and at depth of 2-3 cm. On third day after transplantation irrigate the field.

Young trees show a reduction in growth due to leaf miner. Best management for leaf miner is to leave it alone and let the natural enemies to feed upon them and parasitize their larvae. It can also be controlled by spraying Phosphomidon @1ml or Monocrotophos @1.5ml per 3-4 times fortnightly. Pheromone traps are also available for detecting leaf minor moths.\nCitrus Psylla\n: These are Juice sucking pests. Damage is mainly caused by Nymphs. It injects a plant toxin liquid which burns foliage and skin of fruit. Leaves curl and fall off prematurely. It can be controlled by pruning of diseased plants, burning them. Spraying of Monocrotophos-0.025% or carbaryl- 0.1% can also be helpful.\nScale Insects:\nCitrus scale insects are small insects that suck sap from the citrus trees and fruits. Honeydew is produced which is feasted upon by ants. They do not have much mouth parts. Male citrus scale has a short life span. There are mainly two types of scale on citrus plants armored scale and soft scales.  Armored scale insects insert their mouth parts in the plant and never move again, eating and reproducing in the same spot. Soft scale bugs on citrus form a protective coating, which in turns cover citrus leaves and prevents photosynthesis. Once dead, soft scale will fall from tree instead of remaining stuck. They can be controlled with the introduction of indigenous parasitic wasps. Neem oil is also effective against them. Spraying of Parathion (0.03%) emulsion, dimethoate 150ml or malathion @0.1% are effective against scale control.\nAphids & Mealy Bugs:\nThey are small sap sucking pests. Bugs are present on the underside of leaves. Synthetic pyritheriods or pest oil can be used to control aphids and bugs.\nDisease and Their Management\nCitrus Canker:\nPlants have lesions on stems, leaves and fruits with brown, water-soaked margins. Citrus canker bacteria can enter through plant’s stomata into the leaves. Younger leaves are highly susceptible. Lesions oozes bacterial cells which can be dispersed by blowing wind to healthy plants in area.\nContaminated equipment tends to spread disease to healthy plants. Bacteria can stay viable in old lesions for several months. It can be detected by appearance of lesions. It can be controlled by cutting of effected branches, twigs. Spraying of Bordeaux mixture @1%. Aqueous solution of 550ppm, Streptomycin Sulphate is also helpful in controlling citrus canker.\nGummosis:\nExudation of gum from bark of tree is the characteristic symptom of gummosis disease. Affected plant leaves turns to pale yellow in color. Hardness masses of gum are common on stem and leaf surfaces. In severe cases, bark may be destroyed by rotting and tree may dies. Plant dies before the fruit matures. This disease is also called foot rot. This disease can be managed through proper selection of site with proper drainage, use of resistant varieties etc. Plant injuries should be avoided. Drench the soil with 0.2% metalaxyl MZ-72 + 0.5% trichoderma viride, which helps to control this disease. Bordeaux mixture should be applied to plant upto 50-75 cm height from ground level at least once in a year.\nPowdery mildew:\nWhite cottony powdery growth is noticed on all aerial plant parts. Leaves tend to become pale yellow and crinkle. Distorted margins are also seen. Upper surface of leaves are more affected. Young fruits drop off prematurely. Yield is reduced significantly.  To control powdery mildew, affected plant parts should be removed and destroyed completely. Carbendazim, three times at 20-22 days of interval helps to control this disease.\nBlack Spot:\nBlack spot is a fungal disease. Circular, dark spots on fruits are seen. Copper spray in early spring should be sprayed on foliage helps to cure plants from black spots. It should be repeated in 6 weeks again.\nCollar Rot:\nCollar rot is also caused due to fungus. This disease mainly affects the bark on tree trunk. Bark begins to rot and forms a band just above ground surface, this band decay gradually and covers the whole trunk. It is very severe in some cases that even the trees may die. This is caused due to incorrect mulching, injury due to weeding, mowing etc. Tree may lose its vigor. To protect trees from collar rot, cut and scrape away the soft, infected bark to clean the trunk of tree. Mixture of copper spray or Bordeaux mixture should be painted on the affected part of the tree. Remove all the weak, diseased and congested tree branches to ensure proper air circulation.\nZinc Deficiency:\nIt is very common in citrus trees. It is notified as yellow areas between main lateral veins and midrib of the leaves. Twigs may die back, dense shoots having stunted bushy appearance is commonly seen. Fruits tend to become pale, elongated and small in size. Proper fertilizer application should be given to the citrus tree to prevent zinc deficiency. Zinc sulphate should be provided by dissolving 2 table spoons in 10 liters of water. This should be sprayed thoroughly on all the tree branches and foliage. It can also be cured by providing cow or sheep manure.\nIron deficiency:\nColor of new leaves changes to yellowish green. Iron chelates should be provided to the plants. Cow or Sheep manure is also helpful to cure plants from iron deficiency. This deficiency mostly occurs in case of alkaline soils."

    "content": "Pest and their control\nStalk borer or stem borer:\nChilo partellus, commonly  known as stalk borer that appears throughout  the monsoon time period.  It is a serious bug all over the nation.  Chilo lays eggs 10-25 nights  after germination on inferior portion of  the leaf. The larva gets into  in the whorl and then triggers  deterioration in the leaf and cause shot  hole. Larva of stem borer is  yellowish brown with a brown head.\nFor  stem borer, release egg parasitoid Trichogramma chilonis @ 1,00,000/acre  coinciding egg laying period. Three releases at weekly  interval are  desirable. Third release is to be accompanied with larval  parasitoid  Cotesia flavipes @ 2000/acre. Mix Phorate 10% CG @5kg/acre or  Carbaryl  4%G @ 1 kg/acre with sand to make up total quantity of 10 kg  and apply in  the leaf whorls on the 20th day of sowing. Or Spray  insecticide like  Carbaryl 50 WP @ 1 kg/acre on the 20th day of sowing or  Dimethoate 30%  EC @ 250ml/acre. Spray of Chlorpyriphos @ 1-1.5 ml/Ltr of  water at 10-12 days  after germination provides good control.\nCorn worm:\nLarva feeds  on silk and developing grains. Larva of corn worms shows color variation  from greenish to brown. It has dark brown grey lines on the body with  lateral white lines.\nSet up pheromone traps at @6 /acre. Apply  Carbaryl 10 D @10kg/acre or Malathion 5 D @ 10kg/acre on 3rd and 18th day  after panicle emergence.\nPink Borer (Sesamia inference):\nIt inference arises in times of the winter season mainly in peninsular India. Larvae of the pink borer cause damage by feeding on all parts of maize plant except roots. The larvae form circular or “S” shaped tunnels filled with excreta inside the stem and, also show exit holes on the surface. In case of severe damage, breaking of stem occurred. Seed treatment with Carbofuran (40F) 5% W/W @ 2.5 g/kg of seed was also found effective. The Chilo can be regulated by introduction of 3-5 Trichocards (Trichogramma chilonis) per acre at ten days after germination. Light and pheromone traps can be used to assess the incidence of adult moths.\nShoot bug:\nShoot bug laid eggs inside leaf tissue and covered with a white waxy substance. Due to infestation plant become unhealthy, stunted and yellow. The leaves wither from top to downwards. The midribs of the leaves turn red due to egg-laying and may dry up subsequently.\nIf infestation is observed take spray of  Dimethoate @ 2 ml/Ltr of water.\nShoot fly:\nIt is a major pest of South India but sometime observed in spring and summer crop in North India. It causes damage at seedling stage and causes drying of seedling or dead heart.\nTo control shoot fly infestation, Plough land after harvesting of previous crop also remove stubbles and remains of previously harvested crop. Do seed treatment with Imidacloprid @ 6 ml/kg of seeds, it provides good control of the shoot fly. Soil application of  Phorate 10% CG@4kg/acre at the time of sowing. Spray any one of pesticide like Dimethoate 30% EC@300 ml/acre or Methyl demeton 25% EC@400 ml/acre.\nTermites:\nSerious pest of maize observed in most areas. To control apply Fipronil@6kg/acre followed by light irrigation. If the termite incidence is in patches, than spot application of Fipronil@2-3kg granuled/plant should be done. Keep cleanliness in field.\nDisease and their control:\nMaydis leaf blight (MLB):\nMLB is caused by Bipolaris maydis and generally appears in warm tropical and sub-tropical areas to wet temperate climate. Young lesions are small and diamond shaped. As they mature, they elongate. Lesions may coalesce, producing a complete “burning” of large areas of the leaves.\nApplication of 2-4 sprays of Diathane M-45 or Zineb @ 2.0-2.5 gm/litre of water at 7-10 days interval from the first appearance of disease controls the spread of pathogen.\nPost flowering stalk rot:\nIt is one of the most destructive diseases and is caused by complex association of multiple pathogens. It affects roots, crown region and lower internodes of crops. If incidence of this disease is observed then minimize use of  potassium fertilizer. Follow crop rotation. Do not give water stress at flowering stage. Application of bio-control agent such as Trichoderma formulation in furrow @10 gm/kg of FYM at 10 days prior to sowing provides good control.\nBrown stripe downy mildew\n: Lesions start developing on lower leaves as narrow chlorosis or yellow stripes, 3-7 mm wide, with well-defined margin and are delimited by the veins. The stripes later become reddish to purple. Lateral development of lesions causes severe striping and blotching. Grow resistant varieties. Do Seed treatment with Metalaxyl@6 gm/kg of seeds. Remove infected plant and destroyed away from the field. Spray with Metalaxyl@1 gm/Ltr or Metalaxyl + Mancozeb@ 2.5 gm/Ltr of water.\nPythium stalk rot:\nIn this disease, basal internodes become soft, dark brown water soaked, causing the plants lodge. Damaged internodes commonly twist before the plants lodge.\nRemove remains of previous crop and keep field clean before sowing. Maintained optimum plant population in field. Do Soil drenching with Captan at basal internode (5-7 week growth stage)@1 gm/Ltr of water.\nTurcicum leaf blight (TLB):\nThis is one of the most important diseases in Northern and North-eastern hills and peninsular India and is caused by Exserohilum turcicum. If infection take place at silking stage then significant economic damages observed. Early symptoms show slightly oval, water soaked, small spots produced on leaves. First appear on lower leaves in severe infestation complete plant give burning appearance. If not controlled at proper time, it has the potential to cause yield reduction up to 70%. To control take spray of Mancozeb or Zineb @2-4 g/litre at 10 days interval after first appearance of the disease.\nBacterial Stalk Rot:\nThe stalk near the ground become water-soaked with brownish discolouration and are easily breakable and give unpleasant smell.\nAvoid  water logging in field and provide proper drainage. Apply Bleaching  powder containing 33% chlorine@4 kg/acre as soil drench at pre-flowering  stage.\nFall armyworm:\nThey young larvae damages the crop by scrapping the leaf surface and ends up making them papery and the young larvae feed themselves by eating the leaves which results in round to oblong holes. Larvae can be identified by seeing white-coloured inverted Y-shaped mark on the head and four spots arranged in square pattern at the end of the tail.\nControl:\nTry to sow the crop at recommended time. For 20 days old crop, spray coragen@0.4ml/ltr water or Delegate@0.5ml/ltr water. Thereafter for older crop, the amount of dosage and water needs to be increased.\nDeficiency and their remedy\nZinc Deficiency\nMostly observed in areas having use of high yielding variety. Broad band of white-yellow along with reddish veins are appeared on each side of mid rib on second or third leaf from top of plant.\nTo overcome zinc deficiency, apply Zinc Sulphate@10 kg/acre at time of sowing. If deficiency is observed in standing field, apply Zinc Sulphate and mixed with equal quantity of dry soils and apply along the rows."

Corn is ready for harvest when the ear is full size for the variety, has a tight husk, and has somewhat dried silks. The kernels are fully developed and exude a milky liquid when punctured. Delay harvesting causes reduction in sugar content. Whether harvesting is done by hand or machine, sweet corn should be collected at night or early in the morning.\nBaby Corn:\nEars are harvested 45-50 days after emergence, when silks are 1-2 cm long (within 1-2 days after silk emergence). Harvesting is carried out in morning when temperature is low and moisture is high. The picking of baby corn should to be done once in three days and generally 7-8 pickings are required depending on genotypes used.\nPop Corn:\nLeave ears of Popcorn on the plant for as long as possible.

Seeds should be mixed with ash and are left in the shade to dry. To prevent seed viability, they should be sown immediately at a distance of 3-4cm. Germination may take 3-4 weeks. Unhealthy seedlings should be removed from the field. Proper care must be taken to protect the seedlings from various diseases and insect-pests.\nBudding\nSow citrus seeds in nursery on bed of 2mx1m size and with 15cm distance between the rows. When seedlings are of 10-12cm height, transplanting is to be done. Select healthy and uniform size seedling for transplantation purpose. Remove dwarf and weak seedlings. If needed, pruned roots slightly before planting. In nursery, Budding is done when plant are of pencil thickness. Shield budding or T shape budding is done for that, T shaped slot is made in bark of tree at distance of 15-20cm from ground. Horizontal cut of about 1.5-2cm long is given, and vertical cut of 2.5cm long is made from middle of horizontal cut. Remove bud from bud stick and insert it into T shape slots, afterward wrapped it with plastic paper.\nT budding is done during February-March and also in August- September.

    "content": "Insect-Pest and Their Management\nCitrus Psylla\n: These are Juice sucking pests. Damage  is mainly caused by Nymphs. It injects a plant toxin liquid which burns  foliage and skin of fruit. Leaves curl and fall off prematurely. It can  be controlled by pruning of diseased plants, burning them. Spraying of  Monocrotophos-0.025% or carbaryl- 0.1% can also be helpful.\nLeaf miner:\nLarvae inside the upper or lower surface  of young and newly emerged leaves are curled and look distorted. Young  trees show a reduction in growth due to leaf miner. Best management for  leaf miner is to leave it alone and let the natural enemies to feed upon  them and parasitize their larvae. It can also be controlled by spraying  Phosphomidon @1ml or Monocrotophos @1.5ml per 3-4 times fortnightly.  Pheromone traps are also available for detecting leaf minor moths.\nScale Insects:\nCitrus scale insects are small  insects that suck sap from the citrus trees and fruits. Honeydew is  produced which is feasted upon by ants. They do not have much mouth  parts. Male citrus scale has a short life span. There are mainly two  types of scale on citrus plants armored scale and soft scales.  Armored  scale insects insert their mouth parts in the plant and never move  again, eating and reproducing in the same spot. Soft scale bugs on  citrus form a protective coating, which in turns cover citrus leaves and  prevents photosynthesis. Once dead and soft scale will fall from tree  instead of remaining stuck. They can be controlled with the introduction  of indigenous parasitic wasps. Neem oil is also effective against them.  Spraying of Parathion (0.03%) emulsion, dimethoate 150ml or malathion  @0.1% are effective against scale control.\nOrange Shoot Borer:\nFreshly hatched larvae bore into twigs. They feed upon soft tissues. This insect feed upon trees in the day hours. Affected plants tend to lose its vigor. It is very serious pest of citrus plant. It can be controlled by destroying the affected branches. Kerosene oil/petrol injection can also help to control this insect. Monocrotophos (5ml/20ml of water) also helps to control orange shoot borer.\nAphids & Mealy Bugs:\nThey are small sap sucking  pests. Bugs are present on the underside of leaves. Synthetic  pyrethroids or pest oil can be used to control aphids and bugs.\nDisease and Their Management\nCitrus Canker:\nPlants have lesions on stems, leaves  and fruits with brown, water-soaked margins. Citrus canker bacteria can  enter through plant’s stomata into the leaves. Younger leaves are highly  susceptible. Lesions oozes bacterial cells which can be dispersed by  blowing wind to healthy plants in area.\nContaminated equipment  tends to spread disease to healthy plants. Bacteria can stay viable in  old lesions for several months. It can be detected by appearance of  lesions. It can be controlled by cutting of effected branches, twigs.  Spraying of Bordeaux mixture @1%. Aqueous solution of 550ppm,  Streptomycin Sulphate is also helpful in controlling citrus canker.\nGummosis:\nExudation of gum from bark of tree is the  characteristic symptom of gummosis disease. Affected plant leaves turns  to pale yellow in color. Hardness masses of gum are common on stem and  leaf surfaces. In severe cases, bark may be destroyed by rotting and  tree may dies. Plant dies before the fruit matures. This disease is also  called foot rot. This disease can be managed through proper selection  of site with proper drainage, use of resistant varieties etc. Plant  injuries should be avoided. Drench the soil with 0.2% metalaxyl MZ-72 +  0.5% trichodermaviride, which helps to control this disease. Bordeaux  mixture should be applied to plant upto 50-75 cm height from ground  level at least once in a year.\nPowdery mildew:\nWhite cottony powdery growth is  noticed on all aerial plant parts. Leaves tend to become pale yellow and  crinkle. Distorted margins are also seen. Upper surface of leaves are  more affected. Young fruits drop off prematurely. Yield is reduced  significantly.  To control powdery mildew, affected plant parts should  be removed and destroyed completely. Carbendazim, three times at 20-22  days of interval helps to control this disease.\nBlack Spot:\nBlack spot is a fungal disease.  Circular, dark spots on fruits are seen. Copper spray in early spring  should be sprayed on foliage helps to cure plants from black spots. It  should be repeated in 6 weeks again.\nCollar Rot:\nCollar rot is also caused due to fungus.  This disease mainly affects the bark on tree trunk. Bark begins to rot  and forms a band just above ground surface, this band decay gradually  and covers the whole trunk. It is very severe in some cases that even  the trees may die. This is caused due to incorrect mulching, injury due  to weeding, mowing etc. Tree may lose its vigor. To protect trees from  collar rot, cut and scrape away the soft, infected bark to clean the  trunk of tree. Mixture of copper spray or Bordeaux mixture should be  painted on the affected part of the tree. Remove all the weak, diseased  and congested tree branches to ensure proper air circulation.\nZinc Deficiency:\nIt is very common in citrus trees.  It is notified as yellow areas between main lateral veins and midrib of  the leaves. Twigs may die back, dense shoots having stunted bushy  appearance is commonly seen. Fruits tend to become pale, elongated and  small in size. Proper fertilizer application should be given to the  citrus tree to prevent zinc deficiency. Zinc sulphate should be provided  by dissolving 2 table spoons in 10 liters of water. This should be  sprayed thoroughly on all the tree branches and foliage. It can also be  cured by providing cow or sheep manure.\nIron deficiency:\nColor of new leaves changes to  yellowish green. Iron chelates should be provided to the plants. Cow or  Sheep manure is also helpful to cure plants from iron deficiency. This  deficiency mostly occurs in case of alkaline soils."

Before planting, clear land and remove remains of earlier plants. Then levelled land properly and give gentle slope for water drainage.\nSowing Depth\nDig a pit of 1x1x1 m size and fill pits one month before planting in November month with top soil and add well rotten farm yard manure and then allow it to settle. Finally pit should be filled with sub soil mixed with 10-15 kg of well decomposed cow dung, 500 kg SSP and drench the pit with Chlorpyriphos@50ml/10litre of water per pit. After planting, irrigation should be done.\nMethod of sowing\nFor planting, square or rectangular planting can be adopted. In hilly areas contour system of planting is used for cultivation.\nPropagation\nThe seedling rootstocks used for pear are Kainth. Collect fully mature seeds of Kainth from September end to October first week crops. Extract seeds and place them in wooden box containing alternate layer of moist sand in December month for 30days. In January month sow them in nursery. In 10days seeds get germinate. Seedling is ready for grafting in January of next year.\n2) Place seeds in wooden box containing moist sand layer for germinate. They get germinated with 10-12days. After then, place seedling in field at distance of 10cm. Keep 60cm distance after every four lines. Seedling is ready for grafting in December-January.\nPear is T budded or tongue grafted on kainth seedling. Grafting is done in December January or T budded in May-June.\nIntercrops\nIn kharif season, crop like Mash, Moong, Toria can be taken as intercrops whereas in Wheat, Pea, Gram are taken as rabi crop during non-bearing season.\nPruning and Training\nTraining is done for the development of strong framework of scaffold branches to get higher yield and quality fruit. The pear trees are trained according to modified central leader system.\nPruning:\nRemove all diseased, dead, broken weak branches, head back 1/4th during dormant season to induce spreading of branches."

Adults are black beetles with bright red coloration on the forewings.\nTo control it, spraying Deltamethrin 2.8EC @ 200ml or Indoxacarb 14.5SC @ 200ml per acre using 100-125 litres of water per acre. Take spray in evening hours and if necessary repeat the spray after 10 days.\nPod Borer:\nThis is the most serious pest and causes  damage up to 75% reduction in yield. It feed on leaves causes  skeletonization of leaves also feeds on flower and green pods. On pods  they make circular holes and feed on grains.\nInstall Pheromone traps for Helicoverpa armigera @ 12/ha. In case of  low infestation, handpicked grown up larvae. At early stage use HNPV or  Neem extract @ 50gm/Litre of water. Use of chemicals are necessary after  ETL level. (ETL: 2 early instar larvae/plant or 5-8 eggs/plant).\nIf incidence is observed, spray crop with Indoxacarb 14.5SC @ 200ml  or Spinosad 45SC @ 60ml/100-125litres of water per acre using manually  operated knapsack sprayer. Take spray in evening hour.\nDisease and their control\nCercospora leaf spot:\nGreyish brown to dark spots are observed under surface of leaves. In severe condition spots are observed on petioles and stems along with leaf drop.\nTo control this disease, use disease free seeds and before sowing treat seeds with Captan or Thiram@3gm per kg seed.\nWilt:\nThis disease causes considerable loss in  yield. It can affect at the seedling stage as well as in an advanced  stage of plant growth. Initially affected plant show dropping of petioles  and gives dull green color. Afterwards all leaves turn yellow and  become straw colored.\nGrow resistant varieties. In primary stage of wilt, to control mix 1  kg of Trichoderma in 200 kg well decomposed cow dung and keep it for 3  days, then apply it in wilt affected area. If wilt is observed in  fields, spray 300 ml Propiconazol with 200 Litre of water per acre.\nCankers\n: It causes due to various fungus. Cankers are developed on stem and twigs. It causes breaking of plants at affected place.\nFollow suitable crop rotation. In severe conditions, spray crop with Mancozeb 75WP @ 2gm per Litre of water.\nSterility Mosaic:\nIt is caused due to eriophyid  mite. Due to infection of this disease, either no flowering or little  flowering is observed. Leaves are of pale color. Plant gives bushy  appearance.\nGrow resistant variety. For mite control Spray Fenazaquin 10% EC @ 300 ml/acre with 200 Ltr water.\nPhytophthora stem blight\n: If it occurred at seedling  stage, young seedling dies after emergence. Brown or black necrotic  lesions are observed on stem. On leaflet, circular or irregular lesions  are form and whole foliage becomes blighted.\nIf Infestation Phytophthora blight observed, to control spray with Metalaxyl 8%+Mancozeb 64% @ 2gm/Ltr of water."

Nursery area is about 1/10 of the area to be transplanted. Broadcast Pre-germinated seeds on puddled and levelled soil. Keep the beds moist for the first few days. Do not flood the beds. When the seedlings are about 2 cm high, keep the beds submerged in a shallow layer of water. Apply dose of 26 kg/acre Urea about a fortnight after sowing. For transplantation use seedlings of 15-21 days or when seedlings are 25-30 cm long. Regularly irrigated the nursery.\nDry Bed:\nIt is prepared in dry soil condition. Total seed bed area is about 1/10 of the area to be transplanted. Make seed bed of convenient dimensions with the soil raised at height of 6-10 cm. Spread half burned rice husk on these beds for easy uprooting. Irrigation should be done properly because less moisture can damage seedling. Incorporate basal fertilizer for proper nutrients.\nModified Mat nursery\n: This is the modified method of nursery making which require less space and less quantity of seeds. It can be cultivated at any place having flat surface and assured water supply. The area needed is about 1% of the transplantable land. Establishing seedlings in 4 cm layer of soil mix, arranged on a firm surface. Make 1 meter wide and 20-30 meter long plot and spread plastic sheet or banana leaves on it. Place a wooden frame with 4 cm deep and then fill the frame with soil mixture. Sow pre-germinated seed in it and cover the seed with dry soil. Immediately sprinkle water on it. Irrigate frame as and when needed and keep it moist. Seedlings are ready for transplanting within 11 to 14 days of sowing. Transport seedling mat to field and separate them and transplant 1-2 seedlings at 20x20 cm or 25x25 cm spacing.\nDepth of planting\n: The seedlings should be transplanted at 2 to 3 cm depth. Shallow planting gives better yields.\nMethod of Transplanting\n1) Flat puddled transplanting\n: Transplant seedlings in line at 20x15 cm for normal and 15x15 cm for late transplanting. Put 2 seedlings per hill and the seedlings should be transplanted upright and about 2-3 cm deep.\n2) Bed Transplanting\n: Transplant seedlings on middle of slopes of bed. These bed are prepared by wheat bed planter in heavy soil. Before transplanting irrigate the furrows, then transplant seedlings by maintaining a plant to plant distance of 9 cm.\n3) Mechanical transplanting:\nFor transplanting Mat type nursery, mechanical transplanter are used.

Observed in areas having excessive use of Nitrogen.\nIf infestation is observed, spray with Zineb@500 gm/acre in 200 Ltr of water.\nKarnal Bunt:\nFew grains  in panicle get affected first and part of grain gets converted into  black powder. In severe condition whole panicle gets affected and black  powder spread on leaves, grains etc.\nTo control this disease,  avoid excess use of Nitrogen. When crop is at 10% flowering stage, take  spray of Tilt 25 EC @200 ml/200 litre of water. Repeat the spray with  interval of 10 days.\nBrown leaf spot\n: It produces oval, eye-shaped spots with a conspicuous dark-brown dot in the centre and light brown margin. Spots are developed on grains also. In low nutrient soil, this attacked more.\nTo keep check on this disease, give balance amount of nutrient. When crop is at boot stage take spray of Tebuconazole @ 200 ml or Propiconazole @200 ml in 200 Ltr of water. After 15 days repeat the spray.\nFalse smut:\nThis fungus developed large greenish velvety spore-balls on individual grains. In humid, high rainfall and cloudy conditions, chances of spread of disease are high. Excessive use of Nitrogen also increases intensity of attack.\nTo control this disease spray with 500 gm Copper Oxychloride per acre in 200 Ltr of water at boot stage in crop. With interval of 10 days, take spray with Tilt 25 EC @ 200 ml/200 liters of water.\nSheath blight\n: On leaf sheath, greyish lesion with purple margin is developed. Later these lesions get developed and enlarge. In severe condition, poor grain filling is observed. Avoid excess use of Nitrogen. Keep field clean.\nIf incidence of disease is observed, spray crop with Tebuconazole or Tilt 25 EC@200 ml or Carbendazim 25% @200 gm in 200 Ltrs of water per acre. Repeat the spray after 15 days interval."

Maggots are of yellowish color and grow inside stem leads to cut of stem. Shoot get dried and produces \"dead heart\". Side tillers are produces in affected plant. Plant come out easily when pulled out and gives bad smell. One to six week seedlings are more susceptible to this pest.\nDo not delay in sowing. After harvesting of previous crop, clean field and remove remains of earlier plants. At time of sowing, soil application of Phorate 10G@7kg/acre or Carbofuran@13kg/acre will help to control it. Before sowing do seed treatment with Imidacloprid 70WS@4ml/kg of seeds. Remove infected seedlings and destroyed them away from field. If infestation is observed Methyl Demeton 25EC@200ml/acre and Dimethoate 30EC@200ml/acre.\nStem borer:\nOval shape egg bunch observed undersurface of leaves near mid rib. Larvae are of yellowish brown with brown head. Moth is of straw colored. On infestation, withering and drying of central shoot is observed. Bore holes are observed on stem. Series of pin holes on emerging leaves.\nSet up of light traps till mid night to monitor, attract and kill adults of stem borer. Mix Phorate 10G@5kg/acre or Carbofuran 3G@10kg/acre with sand to make quantity upto 20kg/acre and apply in the leaf whorls. Take spray of Carbaryl S50WP@800g/acre.\nEar head caterpillar\n: Eggs are creamy white and of spherical shape. Show color variation from greenish to brown having dark brown grey lines on body. Adults are of light pale brownish yellow moth. On incidence of this pest, earheads are partially eaten and gives chalky appearance. Excreta is observed within ear head.\nTo know intensity of infestation, set up light trap. Use sex pheromone traps@5/acre to attract male moths from flowering to grain hardening. Spray with Carbaryl 10D@1kg/acre or Malathion 5D@10kg/acre.\nEar Head bug:\nWhen grains are at milking stage, nymph and adult suck juice from grains. Because of it grains get shrink and gives black color. Large no of nymphs are observed on ear head. Nymphs are slender, green in color. Male adults of ear head bug are of green color and females are green with brown margins.\nOn 3\nrd\nand 18\nth\ndays after panicle emergence, do dusting of Carbaryl 10D@10kg/acre or Malathion 5D@10kg/acre. Spray with Malathion 50EC@400ml/acre in 200 litre of water at 10% heading.\nSorghum Midge:\nSorghum midge fly is small mosquito shape having bright orange abdomen and pair of t\nransparent wings and long telescopic ovipositor. Maggots of midge fly feeds on developing grains. Larvae feed on the ovaries and destroyed developing grains results in partial feeling of grains. Red ooze from spikelets show presence of maggots.\nSet up light trap to attract midge fly. Apply Carbaryl 10D@10kg/acre or Malathion 5D@10kg/acre on 3rd and 18th day after panicle emergence.\nDisease and their control:\nAnthracnose:\nSmall red color spots with white centre are observed on both sides of leaves. Numerous small black dots like are seen on the white surface of the lesions which are fruiting bodies of fungus. Circular canker is developed on stalk and influence. When we split infected stem it shows discoloration. This disease spread in continuous rain, high humidity and temperature 28-30\no\nC.\nAvoid continuous growing of crop. Follow crop rotation. Grow resistive varieties. Before sowing crop treat the seed with Captan or Thiram @3 gm/kg of seeds. If infestation observed spray crop with Mancozeb @ 300 gm or Carbendazim @400gm/200Ltr of water.\nRust:\nIt affect at any growth stage of crop. Small reddish brown flecks observed on lower surface of leaves. Pustules appeared on both surface of leaves, on rupture they gives reddish powdery mass. The pustules may also occur on the leaf sheaths and on the stalks of inflorescence. Low temperature 10-12\no\nC along with spell of rainy weather is favourable to this disease.\nGrow rust resistant variety. If infestation is observed spray crop with Mancozeb@250gm/150Ltr of water or do dusting of sulphur@ 10kg/acre.\nErgot:\nSecretion of honey dew from infected florets is main symptoms of this disease. This secretion attracts large number of insects and ants, also head give black appearance. At base of infected plant white spots on soil is observed. High rainfall, high humidity at flowering stage along with cloudy weather is favourable for spread of this disease.\nGrow ergot resistant varieties. Before sowing soak seed in 2% saline solution, ergot affected seeds float on surface, remove them. Do seed treatment with Captan or Thiram@4gm/Kg of seed. Spray with Ziram, Zineb, Captan or Mancozeb@2.5gm/Ltr at emergence of ear head. Take second spray at 50% of flowering. If necessary repeat spray after a week.\nHead mould/Grain mould/Head blight:\nMoist weather at time of flowering or grain filling stage causes fungus growth on earheads. Compact heads are more susceptible to this disease.\nAvoid late sowing. Grow resistant varieties. Before sowing treat seeds with Thiram@3gm/Kg of seeds. In case of intermittent rain during ear head emergence, take spray of Mancozeb@2.5gm/Ltr of water or Captan@2gm/Ltr of water.\nDowny Mildew\n: Whitish growth is observed on lower surface of leaves. The leaves give green or yellow coloration appearance.\nAvoid growing of crop continuously on same field. Follow crop rotation with pulses and oil seeds. Use downy mildew resistive varieties. Before sowing treat seeds with Metalaxyl@4gm/Kg of seeds. If infection is observed spray with Metalaxyl@2gm/Ltr of water or Mancozeb@2.5gm/Ltr of water.\nLeaf Blight:\nIn initial stage small narrow elongated spindle shaped spots are observed. On older plants, long elliptical, necrotic lesions of straw coloured observed in the centre with dark margins. It destroyed large area of leaf and give crop a burnt appearance. High humidity, high rainfall along with cool moist weather are favourable for this disease.\nUse disease free seeds and resistive varieties. Follow proper crop rotation. Before sowing treat seeds with Thiram or Captan@ 4gm/kg of seeds. If infestation is observed spray crop with Mancozeb@2.5gm/Ltr of water, if necessary take second spray with 15 days interval.\nGrain smut/Kernel smut / Covered smut / Short smut\n: Appeared at time of grain formation in ear. Grains gives dirty white or grey color appearance and get covered with white cream. Affected plants can be detected before the ears come out. They are shorter than the healthy plants with thinner stalks and marked tillering. The ears come out much earlier than the healthy.\nUse diseased free seeds and resistive varieties.
