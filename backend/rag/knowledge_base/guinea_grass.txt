Soil
It is grown in variety of soils ranging from moist, damp and fertile soils. It gives best result when grown under deep soil having well drainage system.  Avoid cultivation in heavy clayey and water logged soils. Light irrigation is good for crop growth.
Popular Varieties With Their Yield

PGG 19:
Suitable for cultivation in Punjab. It gives average yield of 450-500 quintals/acre.
Other state varieties:
CO 2:
This variety has 150-200 cm height and leaf length is 65-75 cm. The variety gives 1100 qtl/acre/year. Mainly 7 harvestings is given.
CO (GG) 3:

Hamil:
Suitable for North, South and Central India. It gives average yield of 208 qtl/acre.
PGG 1:
Suitable for sowing in North west, Hills and central India. It gives average yield of 210 qtl/acre.
Land Preparation
For guinea grass plantation, it requires well prepared soil. To bring soil to good level, ploughing is done by mouldboard, then two harrowing’s and cross planking is done. Full seed bed preparation is must for planting guinea grass.
Sowing
Time of sowing
Seeds are sown in the month of mid-March to mid-May.
Spacing
For good growth and development of crop, use spacing of 50 x 30cm or 90 x 45cm.
Sowing depth
Use broadcasting method.
Method of sowing
Sowing can be done with help of plough/cultivator drawn Kera.  Broadcasting method is also used for sowing.
Seed
Seed rate
For good yield use seed rate 6 to 8kg per acre.
Seed treatment
For higher percentage germination, before sowing do seed treatment with concentrated sulphuric acid for 10 minutes. After chemical treatment use the seeds for sowing.
Nursery Management And Transplanting
Soil is well prepared before sowing the seeds. Sow seeds on raised beds of convenient length and width. Seeds must be sown at a depth of 1-2 cm. After sowing covered the seed bed with thin cloth to retain the moisture.
Seedlings are ready for transplantation in 35-45 days after sowing with 3-4 leaves. Transplanting is only done when immediate irrigation is there or before the onset of monsoon. Water seedling beds 24 hours before transplanting so that seedlings can be easily uprooted and be turgid at transplanting time.

At the time of land preparation, apply organic manure i.e. FYM (Farm Yard Manure) @20-25t/acre. 20 days after sowing, apply fertilizer dose of Nitrogen@20kg per acre in form of Urea@44kg/acre. Apply second dose of Nitrogen@10kg in form of Urea@23kg/acre, 35 days after sowing.
One fertilizer dose of Nitrogen @30kg in form of Urea@66kg/acre is given after each cutting.
Weed Control
Regular weedings are necessary at regular interval of time to keep the field weed free. To control weeds spraying of Atrataf 50 WP (Atrazine) @500g in 200 ltr of water is given. Mulching is also an effective way to reduce soil temperature along with weed control.
Irrigation
In summer, subsequent irrigations are necessary and in the month of September-November irrigation is given at the interval of 10 days. First irrigation is given immediately after sowing and then second is given 4-6 days after first irrigation. In rainy season, irrigation is not required or life-saving irrigation is given. Do not over water the fields as guinea grass can’t withstand in excessive water.

Plant protection
Pest and their control:
Grasshopper
: Grasshopper destroys the plants by feeding themselves on fresh leaves.
Treatment: If infestation is observed spray of Carbaryl 50WP@400gm/acre is given.
Disease and their control:
Leaf spot:
It affects the leaves of the plant as it makes spots on the plant and becomes blotch.
Treatment: If infestation of disease is observed in field, spray crop with Copper Oxychloride@300gm/200liter or Mancozeb@250 gm/200ltr, 3 to 4 times in every 15days interval.
Ergot:
It is a fungal disease caused by Claviceps pupurea which infects the ear of the crop as a result the ear growth ceases.
Treatment: Fungicidal treatment is necessary to cure from this disease.
Smut:
It mainly destroys the cereal and fodder crops. The mushroom like tumors or galls is seen on the leaves.
Treatment: Applying fungicides is useful to control the smut disease.
Fusarium wilt:
It restricts the flow of water to foliage by entering through the roots. As a result the foliage turns yellow.
Treatment: To control the disease prepare the solution of Thiophanate  Methyl@10gm and Urea each of 50gm/10litre of water and apply near base  of plants.
Harvesting
Harvesting is mainly done after 55 days of sowing. Around 5-7 cuttings are done at different intervals. First cut is mainly given in about 55 days and then subsequent cuttings are done after the interval of 25-30 days. Harvesting is to be done above the ground level as it will increase crop yield.
