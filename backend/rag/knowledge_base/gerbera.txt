Soil
Light soil having good drainage system is suitable for gerbera plantation. Red lateritic soils are best for the cultivation of Gerbera. 5.0-7.2 pH range is suitable for gerbera plantation.

Land Preparation
For gerbera farming, it requires well prepared land. To bring the soil to fine tilth, do 2-3 ploughings before planting. Prepare the raised beds of 15cm height and 1.2m width.
Sowing
Time of sowing:
Gerbera plantation is done in the month of September to October and February to March.
Spacing:
Use line sowing of 40cm and plant spacing of 30cm.
Method of sowing:
•    Tissue culture method
Seed
Soil treatment:
Fumigation of prepared beds is done with methyl bromide @30gm/m2 or Formalin@100ml in 5ltr of water/m2 to protect crop from soil borne pathogens like Pythium, Phytophthora and Fusarium.
Propagation
Propagation is done through root suckers or tissue culture method.

At the time of land preparation, FYM @20tonnes, add fertilizer dose of phosphorus @40kg/acre in the form SSP@250kg and potash@40kg/acre in the form of MOP@66kg is mixed in the soil. The soil which is iron deficient, add iron sulphate@10gm/m2. After 4-5 weeks of plantation, add Nitrogen@40 kg/acre in the form Urea@88kg is added at the interval of 1 month.
Weed Control
Weeding is necessary in Gerbera cultivation. For first 3 months of plantation, weeding is done once in every 2 weeks and after 3 months of plantation, weeding is done at the interval of 30 days.
Irrigation
Open irrigation is required after sometime to Gerbera crop. In summers irrigation is given at the interval of 5 days and in winters, irrigation is given at the interval of 10 days. Do not moist the land too much as it will cause diseases.
Plant protection
Pest and their control:
Aphids:
They suck sap from leaves and causing yellowing of leaves. They secrete honey dew like substance and black sooty mould is developed on affected areas.
If infestation is observed, spraying of 0.1% Rogor 40 EC@2ml/ltr or Metasystox 25 EC is done after every 15 days.
Whitefly:
If infestation is observed, spraying of 2ml/ltr Rogor 40 EC 0.1% or Metasystox 25 EC is done after every 15 days.
Tunnel worms
: If infestation is observed, spraying of 2ml/ltr of Rogor 0.1% 40 EC or Metasystox 25 EC is done after every 15 days.
Thrips:
Discolouration of plant tissue is observed. Discoloration, rolling and defoliation of leaves are observed due to thrips infestation.
If infestation is observed, spraying of 2ml/ltr of Rogor 40 EC 0.1% or Metasystox 25 EC is done after every 15 days.
Disease and their control:
Alternaria spots:
By this disease light brown color spots are seen on the upper surface of the leaves which become dark brown in color on later stages.
To control this disease, 2gm/ltr of Indofil M-45 @0.2% is given.
Cercospora spots:
By this disease brown color spots are seen on the upper surface of the leaves which become black in color on later stages.
To control this disease, spraying of Benlate @0.1%or 2gm/ltr of Indofil M-45 @0.2% is given.
Root rot
: It is a common disease found in Gerbera plant.
To control this disease, RidomilMZ@0.2% or 2gm/ltr of Thiram @0.3% mixed with soil.
Powdery mildew
: Patchy, White powdery growth appears on lower side of leaves. It parasitizes the plant using it as a food source. It commonly occurs on older leaves but it can develop at any stage of crop development. In severe infestation it causes defoliation.
If infestation is observed take spray of Zineb 75WP@400gm or M-45@400gm per acre in 150 ltr of water.
Stem rot:
This disease mainly affects the lower surface of plant. The disease is mainly caused by some fungus. The disease mainly spread in higher moisture level areas.
To control this disease, RidomilMZ@0.2% or 2gm/ltr of Thiram @0.2% in mixed with soil.
Harvesting
After 3 months of planting, Gerbera start’s flowering. Harvesting of single type variety is done when 2-3 whorls of stamens are developed and double type variety is done when flowers are little riper. After harvesting, flower stalks are dipped in 200mg H.Q.C. or 5% sucrose solution for approximately 5 hours to increase the life of the harvested flowers. In open field, it gives an average yield of 140-150 cut flowers/m
2
/year and in green house; it gives an average yield of 225-250 cut flowers/m
2
/year.
Post-Harvest
After harvesting, grading is done. Then flowers are packed in carton boxes for long distance transportation.
