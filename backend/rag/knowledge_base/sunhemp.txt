Spacing
When crop grown for green manure purpose, broadcasting method is used. For seed purpose use row spacing of 45 cm.
Sowing Depth
Sowing depth should be 3-4 cm.
Method of sowing
Broadcasting method is used in case of green manure purpose and seed drill is used when crop is grown for seed purpose.
Seed
Seed Rate
For green manure purpose, use seed rate of 20 kg/acre is sufficient and for seed purpose use seed rate of 10 kg/acre.
Seed Treatment
Before sowing soak seed for overnight for better germination.

For seed purpose as well as for green manure purpose, apply Phosphours@16 kg/acre. As it is leguminous crop, nitrogen fertilizer are not given. But some time, initially to boost up crop, Nitrogen@4-6 kg/acre is applied.
Weed Control
To keep check on weed population, take one hoeing one month after sowing.
Irrigation
When crop is grown for green manure purpose, it required two - three irrigation depending upon weather conditions. Flowering and grain development stage are crucial for irrigation when crop is grown for grain purpose. Avoid water stress during this period.
Harvesting
For grain purpose, harvesting is carried out 150 days after sowing. (From mid-October to early November). When crop is raised for green manure purpose, 45-60 days after sowing buried crop in soil.
