Land Preparation
For gladiolus plantation, land should be well ploughed before sowing. To bring the soil to fine tilth, ploughing must be done. Application of FYM@20-25tonnes is mixed with the soil. The cultivation of gladiolus is done by making ridges and furrows.
Sowing
Time of sowing:
Tuber sowing should be done in the month of September to mid-November.
Spacing:
Use row to row spacing of 30cm and the distance between tubers should be 20cm.
Sowing depth:
For good growth, sow tubers at depth of 7cm.
Method of sowing:
Tubers or corms are sowing direct in the soil at a proper distance in rows.
Seed
Seed rate:
Use 62500-67000 corms for per acre land.
Seed treatment:
Before sowing tubers are dipped in Bavistin solution @0.2% for half hour to protect them from soil-borne diseases.

Before 20 days of seed sowing, mixed FYM @20tonnes/acre in the soil. At the time of land preparation apply fertilizer dose of Nitrogen @115kg (Urea@250kg), phosphorus @40kg (Single superphosphate @250kg) and potash @40kg (Muriate of potash @66kg) as a basal dose. Nitrogen dose is applied in 2 equal splits, first half dose is applied at 2-3 leaves stage and then half dose is applied at 5-6 leaf stage.
Weed Control
To obtain good yield mainly hand weeding is done which will increase the labor cost. For appropriate control of weeds, 4-5 hand weedings are necessary. For the weed control, before crop growth application of Stomp 30 EC (650ml per acre) is done.
Irrigation
Irrigation must be done depending upon climate and soil. In sandy soil it requires irrigation at the interval of 7-10 days.
Deficiency and their remedy
Iron deficiency
: Yellowing of leaves are the symptoms of iron deficiency in the Gladiolus crop. Spraying of ferrous sulphate @0.2% should be done when seedling has 3-6 leaves is done to cure iron deficiency.
Plant protection
Disease and their control:
Corm rot:
The symptoms are premature yellowing of leaves, stem collapsing and reddish brown color dry rot on corms.
Treatment:
If infestation is observed take spray of Zineb 75WP@400gm or M-45@400gm per acre in 150 ltr of water.
Hard rot
: It is caused by Septoria gladioli. The symptoms are dark brown or black color and sunken lesions are appearing on the corms.
Treatment
: Dip the corms in Thiophanate methyl solution at 85-120°F temperature or in iprodione at suitable temperature for 15-30 minutes to get rid of corm rot.
Root knot nematode:
It is caused by Meloidogyne incognita. The symptoms are stunted growth, wilting and yellowing of foliage and galling of roots.
Treatment:
Treatment with oxamyl solution is given to the infected fields.
Mosaic virus:
The symptoms are yellowing, stunted growth, mottling and ring spots are seen.
Treatment:
If infestation is seen, then spraying of Acephate@600gm in 150ltr of water in per acre of land is done.
Pest and their control:
Aphids:
The aphids destroy the growing young parts of the plants.
Treatment:
Spraying of Rogor30 EC or Malathion 50 EC @3ml/ltr of water is done at the time of flowering to get rid from aphids.
Thrips:
The thrips affect the plant by feeding themselves on sap of leaves and flowers.
Treatment:
Spraying of Rogor30 EC or Malathion 50 EC @3ml/ltr of water is done at the time of flowering to get rid from thrips.
Harvesting
Harvesting is mainly done after 3-4 months i.e. 90-120 days of transplanting. Harvesting is mainly done by retaining at least 4-5 basal leaves of the plant for adequate development of corms and cormels. It gives an average yield of 40000-125000 spikes/acre and 7500-8,000 corms/acre.
Tuber harvesting
: After 6-8weeks of flower harvesting, corms and cormels should be harvested. Stop irrigating the field 2-3 weeks before harvesting. After harvesting the corms are air dried. Clean the corms by removing the leaves from it. Then tubers are dipped in Bavistin solution @0.2% for half hour. After dipping they are dried for 2-3 weeks in shade. After drying they are stored in plastic bags in cold storage at 4
o
C.
Post-Harvest
Freshly cut flowers are stored in card board boxes. These boxes are sold to nearby markets or to flower sellers.
