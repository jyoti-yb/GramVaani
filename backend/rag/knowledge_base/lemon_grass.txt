Soil
It can grow in varieties of soil ranging from clayey to sandy, alluvial soil and loamy soil having good drainage system. It gives best result when grown under loamy-sand soils with high organic content. It can even tolerate poor soil. Avoid cultivation in soil which have poor drainage system or have long water holding capacity. 5.0-8.5 pH soil ranges best for the growth of the crop.

NLG 84:
The variety released in 1994 by AINRP on  M & AP , NDUAT,  Faizabad , Uttar Pradesh. The variety is tall in height i.e. 100-110 cm having leaves with dark purple sheath. The oil content is 0.4% and citral content is 84%. It is grown in Uttar Pradesh.
OD 410:
It is released by AMPRS, Odakkali, KAU, Kerala. It yields oleoresin @1050 kg/acre/year and have 18.6% oleoresin content. It is an ideal solvent for the extraction of methanol.
Land Preparation
For Lemongrass plantation, it requires fertile and irrigated land. Ploughing and harrowing should be done repeatedly. During land preparation mix Lindane powder @ 10kg/acre with soil at the time of last ploughing to protect the crop from the attack of termite. Transplantation of lemongrass is done on raised beds.
Sowing
Time of sowing
Prepare nursery beds in March - April month.
Spacing
Depending upon growth habit 60 cm x 60 cm spacing for seedlings and 90 cm x 60 cm spacing for slips is required.
Sowing Depth
Depth should be 2-3 cm.
Method of sowing
Two month old seedlings is ready for transplantation in main field.
Seed
Seed Rate
Use seed rate of 1.6 - 2 kg/acre.
Seed treatment
To protect crop from long smut disease, before sowing do seed treatment with Ceresan @0.2% or Emisan@1 gm/kg of seeds. After chemical treatment, use seeds for sowing.
Nursery Management And Transplanting
Sow lemongrass seeds on raised beds of 1m-1.5m width and of convenient length. After sowing cover the beds with cut grass material and then it is covered with thin layer of soil.
Seeds are ready for transplantation in about 2 months when plant reaches the height of about 12-15 cm. field should be prepared first before transplanting.  The planting should be done at the spacing of 15x19cm. Do not plant seedlings deep into the soil as this may cause root-rot to occur during rainy season.

In north east area, apply dose of nitrogen @24 kg, phosphorus @20 kg and potassium @14 kg/acre in form of Urea@52 kg, SSP@125 kg and MoP@23 kg/acre. In other conditions apply dose of nitrogen @40 kg/acre as it is recommended by Aromatic Plant Research Station, Odakkali (Kerala).
Weed Control
Do hand weeding and hoeing to keep field weed free. Mulching is also an effective way to reduce soil temperature along with weed control.  Application of organic mulch @1200 kg/acre. 2-3 weeding should be done in one year. Some organic control should be done such as UV radiation and flame weeding.
Irrigation
In summer season i.e. February to June, apply irrigation with interval of 4-6 irrigations are given. When rains are not in regular pattern then apply irrigation with interval of 3 days in first month and then with the interval of 7-10 days.  4-6 irrigations are necessary for the crop during summer months.
Plant protection
Pest and their control:
Stem boring caterpillar:
The caterpillar makes hole in the bottom of the stem and they feed themselves on plant. Drying of centre leaf is the first symptom.  Application of spray of Folidol E 605 is done to cure pests.
Nematodes:
They infect the whole grass.
Application of Fenamiphos @4.5 kg/acre is done to prevent crop from the pest.
Disease and their control:
Long smut:
The flowers starts turning into cream colored sori. The disease starts infecting the flower from the tip and then slowly reaches the whole flower.
To get rid of long smut apply spray of Dithane Z-78 @2% before flower initiation or treat the seeds with Cersan @0.2% or Emisan-6 @1g/kg before sowing.
Red Leaf Spot:
This disease causes the brown spots having concentric rings appear on the lower side of the leaves. Later the spot become bigger and the whole leaf turns dry.
Apply two sprays of Bavistin @0.1% at the interval of 20 days or 3 sprays of Dithane M-45 @0.2% at the interval of 10-12 days.
Leaf Blight:
The disease causes circular and reddish brown spots on leaf tips and margins. They cause premature dying of leaves and makes it infectious.
To get rid of this disease spray Dithane Z-78 @0.2% at the interval of 10-12 days or spraying of Copper oxychloride @0.3% is to be done.
Rust:
The disease causes brown and discrete uredinia on lower surface of leaves having chlorotic streaks.
Spraying of Dithane @0.2% or Copper oxychloride @0.3% or Plantavax @0.1% at the interval of 10-12 days will help to kill the disease.
Little Leaf or Grassy shoot:
It causes stunting and short leaf formation.
Application of spray Dithane Z-78 before flowering at the interval of 10-12 days should be done to reduce the risk of disease.
Harvesting
Plants start yielding by 4-6 months after transplantation. Harvesting is done at the interval of 60-70 days. Sickles are used for harvesting. The harvesting start in May and ends in January month. With the help of sickle, grass is cut at 10-15 cm above from the ground level for harvesting.
Post-Harvest
After harvesting, distillation is done. Before distillation the lemongrass is dipped in sodium chloride solution for 24 hours as it will increase the citral content in crop. Then grass is stored in shady place and is packed in bags or packets for transportation in local markets. From mature lemongrass several products like lemon grass oil and lemon grass lotion are made after processing.
