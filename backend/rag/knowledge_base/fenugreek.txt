Soil
It can be grown in all type of soil rich in organic content but give best result when grown in well drained loamy or sandy loam soils. It can tolerate pH of range 5.3 to 8.2.
Popular Varieties With Their Yield
ML 150:
Its plant leaves are dark green, also bears more pods. Seeds are bright, yellow and bold. It is also used for fodder purpose. It gives an average yield of 6.5 qtl/acre.
Other States Variety
Other commercial variety:
Kasuri, Methi No 47, CO 1, Hissar Sonali, Methi no 14. Pusa early bunching, Rajendra Kranti
HM 219:
High yielding variety, gives average yield of 8-9 qtl/acre. It is resistant to powdery mildew disease.
Land Preparation
Plough the land for two - three times and bring soil to fine tilth. After then carry out planking operation to make land levelled and uniform. Add 10-15ton/acre of well decomposed cow dung at time of last ploughing. For sowing prepared flat beds of 3x2m.
Sowing
Time of sowing
Last week of October and first week of November is best time for sowing.
Spacing
Line to line distance of 22.5 cm is used.
Sowing Depth
Sow seeds on bed at depth of 3-4 cm.
Method of sowing
For sowing broadcasting method is used.
Seed
Seed Rate
For sowing one acre land, seed rate of 12 kg/acre is used.
Crop Rotation
Fenugreek can be rotated with Kharif crops like Paddy, maize, green gram, fodder crops etc.
Seed treatment
Before sowing,soaked seeds in water for 8-12 hr. To protect seeds from soil born pest and diseases, treat them with Thiram@4 gm/kg of seed or Carbendazim 50%WP@3 gm/kg of seed. After chemical treatment, treat seeds with Azospirillum@300 gm/acre + Trichoderma Viride@20 gm/acre for 12 kg of seeds.

To attain fast growth 15-20 days after germination take spray of Triacontanol hormone@20ml/10 Ltr. Also one spray of NPK(19:19:19) fertilizer@75 gm/15 Ltr of water at 20 days of sowing helps in good and faster growth of crop. To obtained more yield, spray Brassinolide@50 ml/acre/150 Ltr water, 40-50 days after sowing. Take its second spray after 10 days. To protect plant from frost injury gives two sprays of Thiourea @150 gm/acre/150 Ltr of water at 45 & 65 days after sowing.
Weed Control
Give one or two hoeings operations to keep field weed free. Take first weeding 25-30days after sowing and second 30days after first weeding. To control weeds chemically, pre-plant application of Fluchloralin@800 ml/acre is recommended or for weed control spray with Pendimethaline@1.3 ltr/acre, by mixing in 200 ltr water within1-2 days of sowing at proper soil moisture.
When plant is about 4 inch height, do pinching operation, it will encourages branching.
Irrigation
For quick germination of seed, give pre-sowing irrigation. Generally three to four irrigations on 30
th
day, 75
th
day, 85
th
and 105
th
day after sowing are required for optimum yield of fenugreek crop. Water stress at pod development and seed development stage leads to heavy loss in yield so avoid water stress at this stage.
Plant protection
Pest and their control:
Aphid
: If Infestation of Aphid is observed, to control take spray of Imidacloprid@3ml/10Ltr water or Thiamethoxam@4gm/10Ltr of water.
Diseases and their control:
Root rot
: To protect crop from root rot, as preventive measure do soil application of Neem Cake@60kg/acre. Also treat seeds with Trichoderma viride@4gm/kg of seed. If infestation of root rot, observed in field to control, drenched soil with Carbendazim @5gm/Ltr of water or Copper oxychloride@2gm/litre of water.
Powdery Mildew:
Patchy, white powdery growth appears on upper surface of leaves.
If infestation is observed take spray of water soluble Sulphur@20gm/10Ltr of water. If needed repeat spray with interval of 10days.
Moreover take spray of Penconazole10%EC (Topas) @200ml/acre in 200Ltr of water.
Harvesting
For vegetable purpose, harvesting of crop can be started from 20-25days after sowing whereas for grain purpose, harvesting is done 90-100days after sowing. For grain purpose, harvest when lower leaves turn yellow and starts shedding and pods turn to yellowish color. Use sickle for harvesting purpose.
Post-Harvest
After harvesting, tie crops in bundle and allowed to dry in sunlight for 6-7days. After proper drying, carry out threshing after then cleaning and grading operation.
