Apply Nitrogen@40kg in the form of Urea@90kg/acre in three splits. Apply half at the time of sowing and remaining in two equal splits after first and second cutting of leaves. When crop is grown for seed purpose, apply Nitrogen@30kg/acre i.e 65kg/acre in two doses, half at sowing time and remaining at time of flower initiation.
To attain fast growth 15-20 days after germination take spray of Triacontanol hormone@20ml/10Ltr. Also one spray of N:P:K(19:19:19) fertilizer@75gm/15Ltr of water at 20 days of sowing helps in good and faster growth of crop. For obtaining more yield, spray Brassinolide@50ml/acre in150Ltr water, 40-50 days after sowing. Take second spray after 10 days. Also one spray of Mono ammonium Phosphate 12:61:00@45gm/15Ltr of water at leaf and branches growing stage helps in good growth and increases yield.
Weed Control
At initial growth stage of coriander, weed is a serious problem. Take one or two weeding operations to keep field weed free. Take first weeding 4week after sowing and second 5-6week after sowing.
Irrigation
Irrigation should be given according to soil moisture present in the  soil. First irrigation should be given immediately after sowing of  seeds. Subsequent irrigations should be given at 10 to 12days interval.
Plant protection
Pest and their control:
Aphid:
If Infestation of Aphid is observed, to control take spray of Imidacloprid@6ml/10Ltr water or Thiamethoxam@4gm/10Ltr of water.
Disease and their control:
Powdery Mildew:
Patchy, White powdery growth appears on upper surface of leaves.
If  infestation is observed take Spray of water soluble Sulphur@20gm/10Ltr  of water. If needed repeat spray with interval of 10days or take spray  of Propiconazole10EC (Topas)@200ml/acre in 200Ltr of water.
Grain Mould
: To prevent crop from grain mould, take spray of Carbendazim@200gm/acre 20 days after grain set.
Root rot:
To protect crop from root rot, as  preventive measure do soil application of Neem Cake@60gm/acre. Also  treat seeds with Trichoderma viride@4gm/kg of seed.
If infestation of root rot, observed in field to control, drenched  soil with Carbendazim @5gm/Ltr of water or Copper oxychloride@2gm/litre  of water.
