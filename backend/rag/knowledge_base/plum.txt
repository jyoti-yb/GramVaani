Land Preparation
Do ploughing, cross ploughing of land and then levelled the land. Prepare land in such way that water stagnation should not occurred in field.
Sowing
Time of sowing
Planting is done in first fortnight of January.
Spacing
The ideal spacing of plum plant is 15cm X 30cm. The tree should be planted 6m X 6m apart from row and between plants.
Method of sowing
Direct sowing of seedlings.
Seed
Seed Rate
The plum seed accommodates 110 tree/acre.
Propagation
Plums could be propagated efficiently on peach, plum with apricot rootstocks. For light ground area usage of peach rootstock is advisable, while for heavy garden soil, plum Kabul Green Gage cuttings and apricot rootstocks provide good outcome. Planted cuttings of Kala Amritsari are helpful straight away without budding. To do this, stem-cuttings are ready in the 1st week of December and after callusing around 30 days it is raised in area from 15cm x 30cm in January.

When the tree is 1-2 years old, apply FYM@6-12 kg/tree, UREA@60-120gm/tree, SSP@95-120gm/tree and MOP@60-120gm/tree. When the tree is 3-4 years old, apply FYM@18-24kg/tree, UREA@180-240gm/tree, SSP@95-120gm/tree and MOP@180-240gm/tree. When the trees is 5 years and above, apply FYM@30-36 kg/tree, UREA@300-360gm/tree, SSP@475-570gm/tree and MOP@300-360gm/tree.
Weed Control
Recommendation of Diuron with terbacil 1.2kg/acre or Simazine 1.6kg/acre is done pre-emergence. In post emergence apply glyphosate@320ml/acre is good to control weed.
Irrigation
Plums are irregular rooted as well as rapid maturing thus requires adequate moisture throughout developing period. Time period of irrigation might rely on numerous aspects like soil variety, weather as well as type of major fruit trees. Regular irrigation at per week timeframe could be utilized in April, May as well as June. Hardly any irrigation is provided at complete blossom phase and ripening phase is provided to prevent flower. Throughout rainy climate no irrigation is needed. The timeframe might rise to twenty days in September, October as well as November.
Plant protection
Disease and their control:
Brown rot (fungus): -
Fruits have brown powdery masses. Fruits shrivel and form ‘mummies’.
Control:
Keep trees well pruned to encourage air circulation. Remove and destroy dropped fruit. Spray with sulfur at pre-blossom stage repeat when shucks split, then weekly for 2 week.
Black knot (fungus):
- Smoky black knots (galls) on twigs and limbs, which range in size from 1 to 30cm.
Control: Plant resistant cultivars, such as ‘president’ and ‘shiro’.  Prune off galls. Make sure to cut at least 10cm below swellings.
Pest and their control:
Plum curculios (weevil):
- Small crescent shaped scars on fruit, which drop easily.
Control: - Pick up fallen fruits frequently. Once petals start to fall, each day spread a sheet below the tree and hit the tree trunk with a padded stick; collect and destroy the curculios that fall onto the sheet. Continue for 3 week.
Leaf-curl plum aphids:
- Leaves and young shoots are twisted and stunted. Tiny, sticky insects are present.
Control: - Carefully timed sprays of horticultural oil will kill these  aphids as they hatch. Or, apply neem when aphids are seen on leaves.
Harvesting
The maturity of plum fruit varies depending on the different types of variety. Plum must ripen fully on tree. The ripe fruit are used in several pickings and are packed with proper care.
Post-Harvest
Due to highly perishable character of plum it needs to be packed properly and are stored in proper temperature as they are chilling sensitive.
