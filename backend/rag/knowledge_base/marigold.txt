Sowing
Time of sowing
Sowing of marigold can be done round the year. In rainy season, do sowing in mid-June and Transplanting in mid-July. In winter, do sowing in mid of September and in mid-October, complete transplantation.
Spacing
Prepared nursery bed of 3m x 1m size. Add well decomposed cow dung on it. Irrigated bed and keep it moist. Crushed well dried flowers and broadcast them on bed or sown in line. When seedlings attained height of 10-15cm, they are ready for transplantation. Transplant seedlings at 35 x 35cm for French marigold while 45 x 45cm for African marigold.
Sowing Depth
Broadcast seeds on nursery bed.
Method of sowing
For sowing use transplanting method.
Seed
Seed Rate
600-800gm seeds are required for one acre land. When crop is 30-45days old carry out pitching operation. It means removal of terminal portion of plant. It help to make plant bushy and compact, also more number of good quality flowers with uniform size are obtain.
Seed Treatment
Treat seed with Azospirillum@200gm mixed it in 50ml of rice gruel before sowing.

Apply basal dose of N:P:K@32:16:32kg/acre in form of Urea@70kg, Single Super Phosphate@100kg and MOP@53kg/acre for good growth. Fertilizer dose changes according to soil type. To give accurate fertilizer dose, do soil testing and apply fertilizer according to it.
Weed Control
Take weeding operation depending upon intensity of weed.
Irrigation
After plantation in field give irrigation immediately. Bud formation to harvesting is most important stage for irrigation. Water stress should not occurr at this stage. Avoid water stagnation in field. In April to June month frequent irrigation at the interval of 4-5 days is necessary.
Plant protection
Pest and their control:
Mealy Bug:
These are observed on leaves, stem and on young shoots. They secrete honey dew like substance and because of it, sooty mould developed on leaves and give black appearance.
If infestation is observed, take spray of Dimethoate@2 ml/litre of water.
Thrips:
Discolouration of plant tissue is observed.  Discoloration, rolling and defoliation of leaves is observed due to  thrips infestation.
To know intensity of thrips, set up yellow sticky trap@20 for one  acre. If infestation is seen, take spray of Fipronil@1.5 ml/litre of  water or Azardiractin@3 ml/litre of water.
Disease and their control:
Powdery Mildew:
Patchy, White powdery growth appears  on lower side of leaves. It parasitizes the plant using it as a food  source. It commonly occurs on older leaves but it can be developed at any  stage of crop development. In severe infestation it causes defoliation.
Avoid water logging in field. Keep field clean. If infestation is  observed in field take Spray of water soluble Sulphur@ 20 gm/10Ltr of  water 2 times with interval of 10 days.
Damping off:
Moist and poorly drained soil causes  damping off disease. It is a soil borne disease. Water soaking and  shriveling of stem occurs. If it appears in nursery, the entire lot of  seedling may get destroyed.
To control, Drench nearby soil with Copper oxychloride@25 gm or Carbendazim@20 gm/10 Ltr of water.
Harvesting
Depending upon variety use, marigold will be ready to harvest in 2 to 2.5 months. French Marigold ready for harvesting in 1.5 month where as two months required for African Marigold. Plucked marigold plants when they attain full size. Harvesting should be done either in morning or evening hour.
