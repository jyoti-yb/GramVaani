Land Preparation
To bring soil to fine tilth, carry out ploughing and hoeing operations. Prepare bed for cultivation, 4-6 weeks before planting. While preparing bed for rose cultivation, add 2tons of well decomposed cow dung and 2kg of Super Phosphate in soil. Then carry out leveling operation for uniform bed formation. Growing rose on bed is more profitable than growing individually in pit.
Sowing
Time of sowing
For Northern states, Mid - October is best time for Rose cultivation. After planting, provide shade, also sprinkled water on plant if strong sunshine is observed. Planting rose in late afternoon gives best results.
Spacing
On bed, plant rose in pit of 30cm diameter and 30cm deep. Keep plant to plant distance of 75cm. Distance between two plants depends upon the variety used.
Sowing Depth
Depth should be 2-3 cm.
Method of sowing
Direct sowing of seedlings.
By cutting method.
Budding method is also used.
Propagation
Propagation of rose is done by rooted cutting or budding on briar root stocks. In Northern Plains, December - February is ideal time for budding (T budding).
Pruning is carried out in second year after planting and then in subsequent years. In Northern plains, rose bushes are pruned in second or third week of October. Remove dead, dry, diseased and damaged shoots and leaves. Also removes shoots which make bush crowded. Climbing roses do not required pruning. After pruning, add 7-8kg of well rotten cow dung per bush and mix well is soil.
Seed
Seed Rate
In green house, rose are planted in 2 rows and density should be 7-14 plants/m

At time of bed preparation, add 2ton of well decomposed cow dung and 2kg of Super Phosphate in soil. At interval of three months apply well decomposed cow dung@10kg and N:P:K@8:8:16gm per plant. Apply fertilizer after completing pruning. To increased flower production, one month after pruning, take spray of GA3@200ppm (0.2gm/Ltr) at early vegetative stage.
To improve stress tolerance take spray of soluble root stimulant (RalliGold/Rizom)@100gm +Teeepol@60ml in 100Ltr water per acre at evening time after irrigation.
Weed Control
To control monocot weeds, use Glyphosate@300 g/acre and for dicot weeds, apply Oxyfluorfen@200 g/acre as pre-emergent treatment.
Irrigation
Plant gets established and get well settle in field. Irrigation frequency varies according to soil type and climate. Modern irrigation technique like drip irrigation is useful for rose cultivation. Avoid sprinkler irrigation as chances of infection of leaf disease increases.
Plant protection
Pest and their control:
Caterpillar:
If infestation of caterpillar is for effective control take spray of Methomyl along with sticker@1ml/Ltr.
Thrips, aphids and Leaf hopper:
If infestation is observed, take spray of Methyl Demeton 25EC@2ml/Ltr of water or Carbofuran 3G@5gm/plant.
Disease and their control:
Leaf Spot:
If infestation of black spot is observed, to control take spray of Copper Oxychloride or Mancozeb@2.5gm/Ltr of water. Repeat the spray with interval of 8 days.
Powdery Mildew:
If Infestation of powdery mildew is  observed, to control take spray of Flusilazole@40ml+Teepol@50ml/100Ltr  of water per acre with power sprayer.
Dieback:
It is common disease and if not control  properly it makes big loss. If infestation is observed, to control take  spray of  Chlorothalonil @ 2gm+Teepol @ 0.5ml/Ltr of water with power  sprayer.
Harvesting
Economical yield from rose is obtained from second year onwards. Harvesting is done with sharp hand pruners, when colour of flower is fully developed and first one or two petals start to unfold but not fully open. Flowers along with prescribed length are cut with hand pruner. According to foreign market standard, for large flower, length of stem varies from 60-90cm and for small flower 40-50cm. Harvesting is to be done early in morning or late in afternoon.
Post-Harvest
After harvesting keep, roses in plastic buckets/container, filled with fresh water having disinfectant and preservative. Then keep flowers in pre-cooling chamber having temperature of 10
o
C for 12hours. After then flowers are graded on the basis of stem length, quality etc.
