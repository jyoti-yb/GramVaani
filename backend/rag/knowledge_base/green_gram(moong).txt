Land Preparation
To bring soil to fine tilth give two to three ploughing. After each ploughing carry out planking.
Sowing
Time of sowing
Optimum time for kharif sowing is first fortnight of July. Optimum time for summer moong cultivation is from March to April.
Spacing
Use row spacing of 30 cm and plant to plant spacing of 10 cm for Kharif sowing. For Rabi sowing use row spacing of 22.5 cm and plant to plant spacing of 7 cm.
Sowing Depth
Sow seeds at depth of 4-6 cm.
Method of sowing
For sowing drill/pora/kera methods are used.
Seed
Seed Rate
For Kharif season, use seed rate of 8-9 kg/acre whereas for summer season used seed rate of 12-15 kg/acre.
Seed Treatment

5 kg of Nitrogen (12 kg of Urea), 16 kg of P2O5 (100 kg of Superphosphate) should be applied per acre at time of sowing.
Weed Control
To keep field weed free, do one or two hoeing, first hoeing four week after sowing and second hoeing two week after first hoeing are required. To control weed chemically, apply Fluchloralin @ 600ml/acre or Trifluralin @ 800 ml/acre before sowing (take sowing on same day). Also after sowing, within two days, take spray of Pendimethalin @ 1Ltr/acre in 100-200 Ltrs of water.
Irrigation
Moong is mainly grown as a kharif crop. If needed provide irrigation depending upon the climatic conditions.
For summer season crop, three to five irrigations are required depending upon soil type and climatic condition. For good yield stop irrigation 55 days after sowing.
Plant protection
Pest and their control:
Sucking pest (Jassid, aphid, white fly)
: If infestation is observed, take spray of Malathion @ 375ml or Dimethoate @ 250ml or Oxydemeton Methyl @ 250ml/acre.
For white fly control, take spray of Thiamethoxam @40gm Triazophos@600ml/acre. If necessary take second spray 10days after first spray.
Mite:
If infestation is observed take spray of Dimethoate 30EC @150ml/acre.
Blister beetle:
They cause damage at flowering stage. They feed on flowers, buds thus prevent grain formation.
If infestation is observed, take spray of Indoxacarb 14.5SC @ 200ml or Acephate 75SC @ 800gm/acre. Carry out spraying in evening hours and if necessary take second spray 10days after first spray.
Pod Borer
: Serious pest cause heavy loss in yield. If infestation is observed, take spray of Indoxacarb 14.5SC @ 200ml or Acephate 75SP @ 800gm or Spinosad 45SC @ 60ml/acre. Repeat spray after two weeks.
Tobacco caterpillar:
If infestation is observed, take spray of Acephate 57SP @ 800gm/acre or Chlorpyriphos 20EC @1.5Ltr/acre. If necessary take second spray 10days after first spray.
Hairy Caterpillar:
To control hairy caterpillar pick caterpillar manually and destroyed by crushing or putting in kerosene water when infestation is low. In case of high infestation, take spray of Quinalphos @500ml or Dichlorvos @200ml/acre.
Disease and their control:
Yellow mosaic virus
: It is spread due to white fly. Irregular yellow, green patches are observed on leaves. Pods not developed on infected plants.
Grow yellow mosaic virus resistant varieties. For white fly control, take spray of Thiamethoxam@40gm, Triazophos@ 600ml/acre. If necessary take second spray 10days after first spray.
Cercospora leaf spot:
As a preventive measure, do seed treatment with Captan and Thiram. Use cercospora leaf spot resistant variety. If infestation is observed take spray of Zineb 75WP @400gm/acre. Take two to three sprays at interval of 10 days.
Harvesting
Best time of harvesting when 85% of pods get matured. Over-ripening of pods should be avoided as produce may be lost due to shattering. Do harvesting with sickle. After harvesting carried out threshing. After threshing, seeds are cleaned and dried in the sunshine.
