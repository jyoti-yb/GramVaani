Land Preparation
For Mint plantation, beds of convenient size are made. Ploughing and harrowing should be done during land preparation. Application of organic manure i.e. FYM @100-120 qtl/acre is mixed with soil. Green manuring is added after FYM.
Sowing
Time of sowing
Optimum time for sowing is from December-January.
Spacing
Suckers are planted at end to end distance of 40 cm and row to row 60 cm distance.
Sowing Depth
Depth should be 2-3 cm.
Method of sowing
Transplanting of suckers in main field.
Seed
Seed Rate
Propagation is done by stolons or branches. For good growth, use stolons at the rate of 160 kg per acre land. Stolons are obtained from previous planting and obtained in the month of December and January.
Seed treatment
To protect crop from stolon root, before sowing do stolon treatment with Captan @0.25% or Agallol solution @0.3% or Benlate @0.1% for 2-3 minutes.
Nursery Management And Transplanting
Do cutting of suckers of length 10-14 cm before sowing. Sow Mint suckers on furrows of convenient size and width. Suckers are planted at end to end distance of 40 cm and row to row 60 cm distance. After sowing, irrigation is given to moist the soil.
After transplanting take spray of Sinbar @400 g/acre for weed control.
To protect from weeding, herbicides spray of Atrazine and Simazine @400 g/acre, Pendimethalin @800 ml/acre and Oxyfluorfen @200 ml/acre are given.

At the time of land preparation, apply FYM @80-120 qtl/acre and mix well in soil. Apply nitrogen@58 kg/acre in the form of urea@130 kg/acre, Phosphorus @32-40 kg in the form of single super phosphate @80-100 kg/acre and Potassium @20 kg/acre in the form of MOP@33 kg/acre.
Weed Control
Do frequent hand weeding and hoeing after the first harvest to keep field weed free. Application of Sinbar@400 g/acre is used to control weeds. Application of organic mulch with oxyfluorfen @200 ml/acre or application of pendimethalin herbicide @800 ml/acre is done to control weeds. If weed intensity is high, take post emergence spray of Dalapon @1.6 kg/acre or Gramoxone @1 ltr/acre and pre emergence spray of Diuron @ 800 g/acre or Terbacil @800 g/acre.
Irrigation
In summers before monsoon depending upon climate and soil 6-9 irrigations must be done. After monsoon crop requires 3 irrigation i.e. one irrigation in each month (September, October and November). In winters, crop does not require too much irrigation but if no rains occur in winter then single irrigation should be given.
Plant protection
Pest and their control:
Hairy caterpillar:
Caused by Dicarsia obliqua. They feed on green leaves and damage the whole plant.
To control this pest application of Malathion or Thiodan @1.7ml in litre of water is done.
Cutworms
: Caused by Agrotis flammatra. It damages the collar region of the plant during spring season.
To control this disease soil is treated with Phorate @10gm before planting is done.
Red Pumpkin Beetle:
Caused by Aulocophora foevicollis. It feeds on fresh greeny leaves and buds.
To control this disease application of Thiodan @1ml in 1 lire of water is given.
Mint Leaf Roller:
Caused by Syngamia abrupatalis. The pest folds the leaf and feed themselves inside the leaf mainly in August-September.
To get rid of this disease application of Thiodan @1.5ml in 1 litre of water is given 2-3 times at weekly intervals.
Disease and their control:
Stolon Rot:
Caused by Macrophomina phaseoli. It occurs on underground parts of the plant causes visible brown lesions resulting in decay.
To control this disease application of Captan @0.25% or Agallol solution @0.3% or Benlate @0.1% are given for 2-3 minutes on the stolons is given.
Fusarium Wilt:
Caused by Fusarium oxysporum. It caused yellowing, curling and drying of leaves.;
To get rid of this disease application of Bavistin, Benlate and Topsin is given.
Leaf Blight:
Caused by Alternaria sp. It causes damage of foliage in summer season.
To control this disease application of copper fungicide is done.
Harvesting
Plants are ready for harvesting after 100-120 days. Harvesting is done when yellowing of lower leaves starts. Harvesting is done with the help of sickle and herbs are removed 2-3cm above ground. Next harvesting is done at the interval of 80 days after first harvesting. For processing fresh leaves are used.
Post-Harvest
After harvesting, distillation is done by stem distillation method. Then mint oil is packed in large steel or aluminum containers. Quick transports are done for less spoilage of crop. From mint leaves several products like mint oil and chutneys are made after processing.
