Soil
Sandy loam soil is ideal for beetroot cultivation. It can be successfully grown in well-drained soils, loamy sand to clayey soil and alkali soils.
Popular Varieties With Their Yield
Advanced varieties:
Tropical beetroot hybrids gives an average yield of 240-320qtl/acre and its juice contain 13-15% of sucrose content.
Land Preparation
Area needs to be ploughed first which is followed by 3-4 harrowing to get fine tilth. For good seed production, land should be well prepared and contains appropriate moisture. Before last harrowing, land should be treated with Quinalphos @250ml /acre to protect crop from Cutworms, Termite and other insect-pests.
Sowing
Time of sowing:
The optimum time for sowing beetroot is October to mid-November.
Spacing:
Use line spacing of 45-50cm for sowing. The plant to plant distance must be 15-20cm.
Sowing depth:
Sow the seed at depth of 2.5cm.
Method of sowing:
Dibbling method
Seed
Seed rate:
Use 40,000 plants for planting in one acre land. Use only one plant for per hill.
Seed treatment:
Seeds are treated with Carbendazim 50WP or Thiram @2gm/kg before sowing.

Apply well rotten FYM@8tonnes/acre and mix it well before sowing.
In the absence of FYM, application of nitogen@60kg/acre in the form of urea@135kg/acre and phosphorus@12kg/acre in the form of SSP@75kg/acre. Application of urea@45kg/acre and full dose of phosphorus should be done at the time of sowing. Remaining urea is applied in two equal splits i.e. 30 and 60days after sowing.
In the presence of FYM, the nitrogen dose should be 48kg/acre (i.e. urea@105kg/acre).
In potassium deficient soils, application of potassium@12kg/acre (MOP@20kg/acre) should be done at the time of sowing. In boron deficient soils, application of boron@400gm (borax@4kg) should be done at the time of sowing.
Irrigation
After sowing immediate irrigation should be given and then subsequent irrigation is done after two weeks of sowing. After that irrigation is required at the interval of 3-4weeks upto end February and at the interval of 10-15days during March-April month. Stop irrigation 2weeks before harvesting.
Plant protection
Pests and their control:
Beet webworm:
If infestation is seen then spraying of Dimethoate 30EC @200ml/acre to get rid from webworm.
Weevil:
If infestation is seen then spraying of Methyl Parathion (2%) @2.5kg/acre is to be done to get rid of this pest.
Aphids and Jassids
: If infestation is seen then spraying of Chlorpyriphos 20EC @300ml/acre is to be done to get rid of aphids and jassids.
Diseases and their control:
Alternaria and Cercospora leaf spot:
If infestation is seen then spraying of Mancozeb @400gm in 100-130ltr of water is done get rid from leaf spots.
Harvesting
Harvesting is done from mid-April to end-May. Harvesting is done with the help of sugarbeet harvester/potato digger/cultivator/by manual digging. Processing should be done within 48hours after harvesting.
