Hello everyone, we are **Team RuntimeTerror404**, building **Gram Vaani** for farmers as part of the **AWS AI for Bharat Hackathon**.

# Gram Vaani  
### Community-Verified AI Voice Assistant for Farmers (AWS AI for Bharat)

Gram Vaani is a voice-first AI system that delivers localized agricultural guidance to rural farmers using basic phones.  
It combines farmer voice input, community reports, weather signals, and AI reasoning to generate trusted, explainable advisories in local languages.

## Problem

Small and marginal farmers lack:
- Access to timely expert advice  
- Reliable local intelligence  
- Digital tools suited for low literacy and poor connectivity  

Most agricultural apps fail due to dependence on smartphones and text-based interfaces.

## Solution

Farmers call a toll-free number and:

1. Speak in their local dialect  
2. System understands crop and location context  
3. Combines:
   - Community farmer signals  
   - Weather data  
   - Government advisories  
   - AI reasoning  
4. Delivers localized advice via voice  

Includes confidence scoring and expert escalation when required.

## Key Capabilities

- Voice-first, multilingual interaction  
- Community-verified advisories  
- Explainable AI responses  
- Human-in-the-loop validation  
- Low-network / 2G compatibility  
- Predictive crop risk detection (future evolution)  

## AWS Architecture

- Amazon Connect / Lex  
- Amazon Transcribe & Polly  
- Amazon Bedrock  
- AWS Lambda  
- DynamoDB + S3 + SNS  
- Weather APIs + Government feeds  

Serverless, scalable, and Bharat-ready.

## Impact Vision

Gram Vaani evolves from a voice assistant into a community-powered agricultural intelligence network enabling:

- Early disease detection  
- Climate-aware advisories  
- Reduced crop loss  
- Inclusive AI access for low-literacy farmers
